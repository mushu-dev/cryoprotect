# Experimental Data System Analysis

## Current Schema Structure

The CryoProtect system includes several schemas related to experimental data:

### Core Experimental Tables (from `033_unified_experiment_schema.sql`)

1. **protocols**
   - Stores template-based protocol definitions with versioning
   - Fields: id, name, description, steps (JSONB), parameters (JSONB), version, etc.
   - Supports parent-child relationships for protocol versioning

2. **experiment_types**
   - Categorizes different types of cryopreservation experiments
   - Fields: id, name, description, protocol_details (JSONB), etc.

3. **tissue_types**
   - Defines biological samples used in experiments
   - Fields: id, name, description, species, taxonomy_id, properties (JSONB), etc.

4. **experiments**
   - Core experiment records with detailed parameters
   - Fields: id, experiment_type_id, title, description, protocol_id, temperature, cooling_rate, thawing_rate, parameters (JSONB), etc.
   - Includes version tracking and provenance information

5. **experiment_results**
   - Stores results from experiments on molecules or mixtures
   - Links to the associated experiment, molecule/mixture, and tissue type
   - Fields: id, experiment_id, molecule_id/mixture_id, tissue_type_id, concentration, viability_percentage, etc.
   - Includes uncertainty quantification and provenance information

6. **equipment_types** & **equipment**
   - Define laboratory equipment categories and specific equipment instances
   - **experiment_equipment** links experiments to equipment used

7. **time_series** & **time_series_data**
   - Support recording of time-series measurements during experiments
   - Enable tracking of data points over time with uncertainty values

8. **validation_rules**
   - Define rules for validating experimental data
   - Support multiple validation types for different properties

### Scientific Model Tables (from `030_scientific_models_schema.sql`)

1. **mixture_optimizations**
   - Stores optimization results for cryoprotectant mixtures
   - Fields: id, name, components (JSONB), optimization_parameters (JSONB), effectiveness_score, etc.

2. **concentration_models**
   - Stores concentration-dependent property models
   - Types: linear, exponential, sigmoid, custom

3. **temperature_models**
   - Stores temperature-dependent property models
   - Types: linear, arrhenius, piecewise, custom

4. **tissue_compatibility**
   - Stores tissue-specific compatibility data for molecules
   - Includes compatibility_score, penetration_rate, and toxicity_score

5. **Custom views and materialized views**
   - `molecule_scientific_data`
   - `mv_molecule_scientific_properties`
   - `mv_mixture_components_expanded`

## Integration with Molecules and Mixtures

- **Molecules and Experiment Results**: Direct foreign key relationships in the `experiment_results` table to `molecules` table
- **Mixtures and Experiment Results**: Direct foreign key relationships in the `experiment_results` table to `mixtures` table
- **Constraint**: Each experiment result must be associated with either a molecule OR a mixture (not both)
- **Scientific Properties**: Views that combine experimental data with molecule/mixture information for easy querying

## Existing API Implementation

1. **Scientific Resources** (`scientific_resources.py`)
   - `ConcentrationModelResource`: Manage concentration-dependent models
   - `TemperatureModelResource`: Manage temperature-dependent models
   - `GlassTransitionResource`: Predict glass transition temperatures
   - `MixtureOptimizerResource`: Optimize cryoprotectant mixtures
   - `SynergyPredictorResource`: Predict synergistic effects between components

2. **Missing API Resources**:
   - No dedicated API endpoints for core experiment tables (experiments, protocols, results)
   - No endpoints for time-series data or equipment management
   - Limited integration with validation rules

## Data Population Scripts

1. **populate_experiments.py**
   - Populates experiments and experiment_properties tables with sample data
   - Creates scientifically accurate cryoprotectant experiment data
   - Includes various experiment types (Slow Freezing, Vitrification, Controlled Rate, etc.)
   - Links experiments to mixtures and includes measurement values

2. **create_experimental_linkage.py**
   - Creates experimental linkage schema between molecules and results
   - Implements schema for linking molecules and mixtures to experimental results
   - Includes sample data generation for experiments, tissue types, and results

## UI Implementation

- **Missing UI Components**:
  - No dedicated UI components found for viewing or managing experimental data
  - No protocol designer or experiment result visualization components

## Areas for Enhancement (per EXPERIMENTAL_DATA_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md)

1. **Schema Consolidation**:
   - Multiple overlapping schema definitions exist
   - Need to consolidate and standardize experiment-related tables

2. **Scientific Data Quality**:
   - Enhance with uncertainty quantification, more metadata fields
   - Add reproducibility features and algorithm transparency

3. **Integration Improvements**:
   - Connect protocol designer with experimental data
   - Strengthen links between molecules, mixtures, and experimental results

4. **Feature Expansion**:
   - Add validation framework for experimental data
   - Implement time-series analysis and visualization
   - Support external data source integration

5. **UI Development**:
   - Develop protocol builder and visualization dashboard
   - Create results explorer interface
   - Implement experiment comparison tools

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the analysis, the following implementation priorities are recommended:

1. **Core Schema Consolidation** (First Priority)
   - Standardize experiment-related tables
   - Implement proper migrations for existing data
   - Add support for uncertainty and metadata

2. **Basic API Implementation**
   - Create RESTful resources for experiments and results
   - Implement standard CRUD operations

3. **Protocol Designer Enhancements**
   - Build template system for protocols
   - Implement versioning and comparison features

4. **Scientific Calculation Integration**
   - Connect with thermodynamic property calculations
   - Implement uncertainty propagation

5. **UI Development**
   - Create experiment design and analysis components
   - Implement data visualization

## Conclusion

The CryoProtect system has a comprehensive base schema for experimental data but requires enhancement in several areas. The planned implementation approach will address current limitations and provide a more robust, scientifically accurate experimental data system.
