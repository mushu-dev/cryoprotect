# Netlify Deployment Update

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to improve the CryoProtect frontend deployment process on Netlify, specifically addressing the homepage layout and deployment configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Homepage Layout
- Updated the homepage from card-based layout to a classic vertical layout
- Maintained all links to key sections (Molecules, Mixtures, Experiments, Protocols)
- Added appropriate header with proper metadata
- Improved text styling for better readability
- Added footer with copyright information

### 2. Build and Deployment Process
- Added `export` script to package.json to enable static site generation
- Updated deployment script to perform static export after build
- Configured deployment to use the static `out` directory
- Ensured compatibility with Netlify's current configuration

### 3. Netlify Configuration
- **Base directory**: `frontend`
- **Package directory**: `frontend/`
- **Build command**: Using pre-built files
- **Publish directory**: `frontend/out`
- **Node.js version**: 22.x
- **Production branch**: netlify-deployment

## Deployment Process

The deployment process now follows these steps:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory
2. Install dependencies if needed
3. Build the Next.js application: `npm run build`
4. Generate static files: `npm run export`
5. Deploy the static files to Netlify: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=out`

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Static site generation provides faster load times
2. **Better SEO**: Pre-rendered HTML improves search engine indexing
3. **Reduced Server Load**: No server-side rendering required at runtime
4. **Consistent UI**: Layout now matches the design shown in production
5. **Simplified Deployment**: Clear process for building and deploying

## Next Steps

1. **Monitoring**: Watch for any performance issues or layout problems
2. **Dynamic Routes**: Ensure all experimental data enhancement routes work correctly
3. **Testing**: Continue testing the site in various browsers and devices
4. **Documentation**: Update project documentation to reflect the new deployment process
