## Database Population Implementation Plan

### Current State
Our database currently has:
- 1,554 molecules with 9,666 molecular properties
- 8 mixtures with 20 mixture components
- Minimal experimental data (3 records in each table)
- 562 molecules with missing critical properties
- Property naming inconsistencies (e.g., "LogP" vs "logP")

### Objective
Implement a comprehensive data population strategy to:
1. Standardize and normalize the existing data
2. Complete missing molecular properties and classifications
3. Expand mixture and experimental data significantly
4. Link all data to scientific literature sources

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Database Structure Consolidation** (Week 1)
- [ ] Clean property type naming conventions
- [ ] Deduplicate property types with different capitalizations
- [ ] Validate relationships and constraints
- [ ] Fix data integrity issues in existing records

**Phase 2: Core Molecule Data Enhancement** (Weeks 2-3)
- [ ] Complete missing molecular properties for 562 molecules
- [ ] Enhance molecule classification data
- [ ] Add structural properties (fingerprints, 2D/3D representations)

**Phase 3: Mixture Data Expansion** (Week 4)
- [ ] Add 20+ well-documented cryoprotectant mixtures
- [ ] Implement mixture classification system
- [ ] Add concentration and composition data

**Phase 4: Experimental Data Population** (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Create protocol library with 15-20 standard protocols
- [ ] Add 30+ common tissue types with taxonomy
- [ ] Import or generate experimental results data

**Phase 5: Literature Integration** (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Create publications table and reference system
- [ ] Link molecules, mixtures, and protocols to sources
- [ ] Implement data extraction tools for papers

### Technical Approach
We'll build on existing import scripts but enhance them:
1. Improved PubChem integration with resilience and wider property scope
2. Enhanced ChEMBL integration with cryobiology-specific filters
3. New experimental data import framework
4. Comprehensive data validation workflows

### Success Metrics
1. Data Completeness: 
   - Core molecule properties > 98% complete
   - Classification coverage > 95%
   - Protocol library covers > 90% of common methods

2. Data Quality:
   - Property value consistency with reference sources > 99%
   - Experimental data matches published results
   - Cross-validation with external databases

3. System Performance:
   - Query response time < 200ms for common queries
   - Import pipeline processes > 1000 compounds/hour
   - Validation suite runs in < 10 minutes
