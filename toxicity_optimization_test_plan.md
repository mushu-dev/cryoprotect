# Toxicity Optimization Testing Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive testing approach for the toxicity data optimization implementation to ensure proper functionality, performance improvement, and data integrity.

## 1. Functional Testing

### 1.1 API Endpoint Validation

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| TC-F01 | Verify all optimized endpoints return correct response codes | All endpoints return 200 OK for valid requests |
| TC-F02 | Verify non-existent molecule IDs return 404 | Endpoints return 404 Not Found for invalid IDs |
| TC-F03 | Test all query parameters for each endpoint | Parameters correctly filter the results |
| TC-F04 | Verify response structure matches API documentation | JSON structure matches expected schema |
| TC-F05 | Test authentication requirements | Unauthenticated requests are rejected with 401/403 |

### 1.2 Data Integrity Testing

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| TC-D01 | Compare data between original and optimized endpoints | Data matches exactly for the same molecule |
| TC-D02 | Verify all toxicity data was migrated correctly | Count of records matches between old and new schemas |
| TC-D03 | Test data consistency in materialized views | View data matches source table data |
| TC-D04 | Test data integrity after view refresh | Data remains consistent after refreshing views |
| TC-D05 | Verify foreign key relationships in new schema | All relationships maintain referential integrity |

### 1.3 Caching Mechanism Testing

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| TC-C01 | Test ETag generation for identical responses | Same data produces the same ETag |
| TC-C02 | Test If-None-Match header with valid ETag | Returns 304 Not Modified |
| TC-C03 | Test If-None-Match header with invalid ETag | Returns 200 OK with full response |
| TC-C04 | Verify Cache-Control headers are correct | Headers match expected max-age values |
| TC-C05 | Test caching behavior after data update | ETag changes after data is modified |

## 2. Performance Testing

### 2.1 Response Time Testing

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| TC-P01 | Measure response time for all endpoints | Optimized endpoints are 70-90% faster |
| TC-P02 | Test response time with increasing data volume | Performance scales linearly or better |
| TC-P03 | Compare response time for cached vs. non-cached requests | Cached requests are 90%+ faster |
| TC-P04 | Test response time for bulk endpoints | Bulk endpoint is faster than multiple individual requests |
| TC-P05 | Measure time for similar molecule search | Response time < 1 second for typical queries |

### 2.2 Database Load Testing

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| TC-L01 | Measure database CPU usage during API calls | Reduced CPU usage by 50%+ with optimized endpoints |
| TC-L02 | Monitor database I/O during API calls | Reduced I/O operations with optimized schema |
| TC-L03 | Test concurrent requests impact on database | System remains responsive under load |
| TC-L04 | Measure query execution plans | Query plans show efficient index usage |
| TC-L05 | Test materialized view refresh performance | View refresh completes in acceptable time |

### 2.3 Scalability Testing

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| TC-S01 | Test with 10x typical data volume | Performance remains within acceptable limits |
| TC-S02 | Test with 10x concurrent users | System handles increased load without errors |
| TC-S03 | Measure resource usage under increased load | Resource usage scales sub-linearly with load |
| TC-S04 | Test bulk endpoint with maximum allowed molecules | System handles maximum load without timeout |
| TC-S05 | Test performance with full dataset | System maintains performance with complete dataset |

## 3. Integration Testing

### 3.1 API Compatibility Testing

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| TC-I01 | Test integration with frontend applications | Frontend works correctly with optimized API |
| TC-I02 | Verify all client applications remain compatible | No client breakage due to API changes |
| TC-I03 | Test with different API versions | Backward compatibility is maintained |
| TC-I04 | Verify error handling consistency | Error responses match expected format |
| TC-I05 | Test integration with other API endpoints | No conflicts with other endpoints |

### 3.2 Environment Testing

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| TC-E01 | Test in development environment | Works correctly in development setup |
| TC-E02 | Test in staging environment | Works correctly in staging setup |
| TC-E03 | Test in production-like environment | Works correctly in production-like setup |
| TC-E04 | Test with minimal user permissions | Functions correctly with minimal permissions |
| TC-E05 | Test with different PostgreSQL versions | Compatible with supported PostgreSQL versions |

## 4. Regression Testing

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| TC-R01 | Verify existing toxicity workflows | All workflows function as before |
| TC-R02 | Test unified scoring calculation | Score calculations match previous results |
| TC-R03 | Verify mixture toxicity analysis | Mixture analysis produces consistent results |
| TC-R04 | Test toxicity data export functionality | Export functions produce identical output |
| TC-R05 | Verify toxicity visualization features | Visualizations render correctly |

## 5. Test Automation

Create automated tests for:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions in the optimized implementation
   - Verify correct ETag generation and caching behavior
   - Test data transformation and filtering logic

2. **API Tests**
   - Test all endpoint responses and status codes
   - Verify response structure and content
   - Test error handling and edge cases

3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Automate performance comparisons
   - Track performance metrics over time
   - Alert on performance regression

## 6. Test Execution Plan

1. **Preparation**
   - Create test database with representative data
   - Set up test environment with original and optimized APIs
   - Prepare test scripts and tools

2. **Execution Order**
   - Run functional tests first to verify basic functionality
   - Execute data integrity tests to ensure no data loss
   - Run performance tests to verify improvements
   - Perform integration and regression tests
   - Execute automated test suite

3. **Reporting**
   - Generate detailed test reports
   - Document any issues or discrepancies
   - Prepare performance comparison charts

## 7. Test Completion Criteria

Testing is considered complete when:

1. All functional tests pass
2. Data integrity is verified
3. Performance improvements meet or exceed 70% target
4. No regression issues are identified
5. All integration tests pass in all environments

## 8. Test Tools

- **JMeter**: For load and performance testing
- **Postman**: For API testing and collection runs
- **pytest**: For automated Python testing
- **pgbench**: For PostgreSQL performance testing
- **explain.dalibo.com**: For analyzing query plans
- **Grafana/Prometheus**: For monitoring system metrics during tests

## Implementation Notes

1. Create test fixtures with representative toxicity data
2. Automate as many tests as possible for repeatability
3. Document all test results with clear metrics
4. Maintain a set of reference queries for performance comparison
5. Test with real-world usage patterns and data volumes
