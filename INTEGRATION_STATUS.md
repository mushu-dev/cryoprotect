# CryoProtect Integration Status

This document provides an overview of the current state of the integration between the CryoProtect frontend, backend services, and Convex database, along with the remaining tasks to complete the integration.

## Completed Tasks

✅ Heroku API CORS Configuration:
- Successfully deployed updated CORS configuration to the Heroku app
- CORS is properly configured to allow frontend and Convex origins
- Test endpoint (/test-cors) is working correctly
- Debug endpoint (/debug/cors) provides configuration information

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. RDKit Service Deployment

⏳ The RDKit service is not currently accessible at `https://rdkit.cryoprotect.app`. This service needs to be deployed with the correct CORS configuration.

**Steps to Complete:**
1. Install fly.io CLI
2. Deploy the RDKit service with the CORS configuration from `rdkit-service/cors_config.py`
3. Verify the service is accessible at `https://rdkit.cryoprotect.app/health`

### 2. Netlify Configuration

⏳ The Netlify frontend needs configuration updates for:

**Redirects:**
- Configure redirects to properly forward API requests through the frontend
- Update netlify.toml with the correct redirect rules

**CSP Headers:**
- Add Content Security Policy headers to allow connections to all required services
- Ensure CSP includes `https://cryoprotect-8030e4025428.herokuapp.com`, `https://rdkit.cryoprotect.app`, and `https://*.convex.cloud`

**Steps to Complete:**
1. Update netlify.toml with the correct redirect configuration
2. Add CSP headers to the Netlify configuration
3. Deploy the updated configuration to Netlify

### 3. Convex Authentication

⏳ The frontend needs to be configured to authenticate with Convex.

**Steps to Complete:**
1. Update the Convex client provider with authentication logic
2. Implement proper session handling for Convex requests
3. Test authentication flow from frontend to Convex

## Verification

Once all tasks are completed, run the following tests:

1. Run the verification script: `node verify-cors-config.js`
2. Run the full connection test: `node test-connection.js`
3. Test real user flows in the application

## Next Steps

1. **RDKit Service Deployment:**
   - Follow instructions in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for deploying the RDKit service
   - Use the fly.io CLI to deploy the service with CORS configuration

2. **Netlify Configuration:**
   - Update the netlify.toml file with the correct redirect rules and CSP headers
   - Deploy the updated configuration to Netlify

3. **Convex Authentication:**
   - Complete the Convex client provider implementation
   - Test authentication flows between frontend and Convex
