# Experimental Data Enhancement System

This document describes the enhanced experimental data system implemented for CryoProtect. The system provides comprehensive capabilities for managing scientific experiments, with a focus on cryoprotection research.

## Overview

The Enhanced Experimental Data System is designed to address the following key challenges in scientific experiment tracking:

1. **Protocol Standardization** - Define and version protocol templates for reproducible experiments
2. **Scientific Rigor** - Track uncertainty and provenance for experiment results
3. **Time Series Data** - Capture and analyze time-dependent measurements
4. **Equipment Tracking** - Associate specific equipment with experiments for reproducibility
5. **Data Validation** - Enforce validation rules for data quality
6. **Comprehensive Relationships** - Link experiments with molecules, mixtures, and tissue types

## Architecture

The system is implemented using Convex as the database and backend infrastructure, providing:

1. **Schema Layer** - Convex schema definitions for experimental data entities
2. **Type System** - TypeScript interfaces for type safety and developer experience
3. **Validation Layer** - Input validation and business rule enforcement
4. **Access Control** - Secure experiment data with user-based and public/private access
5. **Audit Trail** - Track all changes with full history

## Key Components

### 1. Protocol System

Protocols define step-by-step procedures for experiments:

- Protocol templates for standardization
- Protocol versioning with parent-child relationships
- Detailed steps with parameters, duration, and temperature
- Public and private protocols for collaboration

### 2. Enhanced Experiments

The core experiment entity with comprehensive metadata:

- Protocol references for reproducibility
- Environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.)
- Standardized units for scientific accuracy
- Version tracking for experimental iterations
- Provenance tracking for data lineage
- Tagging system for organization

### 3. Enhanced Results

Results with uncertainty quantification:

- Standard deviation for normal distributions
- Range values for bounds
- Confidence intervals with specified confidence levels
- Provenance tracking for result methodology
- Links to molecules, mixtures, and tissue types

### 4. Time Series Data

Support for temporal measurements:

- Multiple time series per experiment
- Timestamped data points with values
- Uncertainty in measurements
- Metadata for context

### 5. Equipment Tracking

Laboratory equipment management:

- Equipment categorization by type
- Calibration and maintenance tracking
- Equipment parameters and settings
- Multiple equipment associations per experiment

### 6. Validation Rules

Ensuring data quality:

- Parameter-specific validation rules
- Range, pattern, and comparison validations
- Severity levels for validation results
- Automatic validation on data entry

## Implementation

The system is implemented as a set of Convex tables, TypeScript interfaces, and API functions:

### Convex Schema

The schema defines the following core tables:

- `protocols` - Protocol templates and versions
- `tissueTypes` - Biological sample definitions
- `enhancedExperiments` - Main experiment records
- `enhancedExperimentResults` - Results with uncertainty
- `equipmentTypes` - Equipment categories
- `equipment` - Specific equipment instances
- `experimentEquipment` - Links between experiments and equipment
- `timeSeries` - Time series definitions
- `timeSeriesData` - Individual time-series data points
- `validationRules` - Rules for data validation

### API Functions

The API provides operations for:

- Creating and versioning protocols
- Managing experiments with full metadata
- Recording results with uncertainty
- Tracking equipment usage
- Managing time series data
- Validating experimental data

## Benefits

The enhanced system provides significant benefits over traditional experiment tracking:

1. **Reproducibility** - Detailed protocols and environmental conditions
2. **Data Quality** - Uncertainty quantification and validation rules
3. **Scientific Rigor** - Provenance tracking and standardized units
4. **Comprehensive Analysis** - Relationships between all experimental entities
5. **Collaboration** - Public/private sharing with proper access control

## Getting Started

To work with the enhanced experimental data system:

1. Read the [API Documentation](docs/experiments/api.md) for available endpoints
2. Review the [Schema Design](docs/experiments/schema_design.md) for data model details
3. See [Usage Examples](docs/experiments/README.md) for common operations

## Comparison with Previous System

|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Protocol Management | Basic text fields | Versioned templates with steps |
| Result Uncertainty | Not supported | Multiple uncertainty types |
| Time Series Data | Limited support | Comprehensive time series tracking |
| Equipment Tracking | Not supported | Full equipment management |
| Data Validation | Manual | Rule-based automatic validation |
| Metadata | Limited | Comprehensive metadata and provenance |
| Access Control | Basic | Public/private with user-based restrictions |

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:

1. Statistical analysis tools for experimental results
2. Machine learning integration for protocol optimization
3. Enhanced visualization for time series data
4. Equipment calibration scheduling and alerts
5. External data source integration (lab equipment, ELNs)
6. Collaborative protocol development workflow

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Experimental Data System provides a robust foundation for scientific experimentation in cryoprotection research. By standardizing protocols, tracking uncertainty, and ensuring data quality, it enables more rigorous and reproducible scientific work.
