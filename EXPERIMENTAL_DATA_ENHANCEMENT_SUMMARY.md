## Technical Approach

### 1. Pages Router Implementation

The implementation uses Next.js 12.3.4's Pages Router (rather than App Router from Next.js 13+) with the following structure:

```
/pages
  /index.js               # Homepage with feature cards
  /experiments
    /index.js             # Experiments list page
    /[id].js              # Experiment detail page (dynamic route)
  /protocols
    /index.js             # Protocols list page
    /[id].js              # Protocol detail page (dynamic route)
    /create.js            # Protocol creation page
```

### 2. Data Handling

- Mock data is used for demonstration purposes
- Services and hooks are implemented for future API integration
- Data structures follow the schema defined in the experimental data enhancement plan

### 3. Component Design

Components are organized following a clear hierarchy:

- **Page Components**: Top-level components that handle routing and layout
- **Feature Components**: Functional components specific to experiments and protocols
- **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements like cards, buttons, and form inputs

### 4. Static Generation Strategy

For deployment on Netlify, we've implemented:

- Pre-generation of dynamic routes for specific IDs
- Custom Netlify redirects for dynamic routes
- Proper fallback behavior for dynamic routes

## Testing and Verification

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Verified all pages render correctly
   - Checked navigation between pages
   - Tested responsive behavior on different screen sizes

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Created direct UI test scripts to verify page content and functionality
   - Implemented checks for expected UI elements on each page
   - Verified that pages return proper HTTP status codes

## Deployment Process

The deployment process for the experimental data enhancement UI involves:

1. Building the Next.js application with static generation enabled
2. Deploying the built files to Netlify using the Netlify CLI
3. Configuring Netlify redirects for proper routing
4. Verifying the deployment with automated tests

## Latest Enhancement: Protocol Step Editor

### Overview

The Protocol Designer has been significantly enhanced to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly interface for creating and managing experimental protocols. The enhancements include:

1. **Comprehensive Step Editor**: A new component for creating and editing protocol steps with advanced features
2. **Improved Visualization**: Enhanced visualization of protocol steps with better information display
3. **Equipment Management**: Support for adding and tracking equipment required for each step
4. **Parameter Management**: Improved interface for defining and managing step parameters
5. **Alert System**: New capability to define alerts and warnings for specific steps with different severity levels

### Key Components

#### Protocol Step Editor

A new `protocol-step-editor.tsx` component has been developed that provides:

- Tabbed interface for organizing step information:
  - Basic Information: Name, description, duration, temperature
  - Advanced Settings: Equipment, parameters
  - Alerts & Warnings: Define conditions that require attention
- Validation to prevent invalid step data
- Step reordering controls
- Equipment and parameter management
- Alert creation with different severity levels (info, warning, critical)

#### Protocol Steps Visualization

The `protocol-steps-visualization.tsx` component has been enhanced to:

- Display step information in a more structured and user-friendly format
- Show equipment and alert indicators
- Provide tooltips for additional information
- Calculate and display aggregate information (total duration, temperature range)
- Improve interaction with steps in edit mode

#### Protocol Builder Integration

The `protocol-builder.tsx` component has been updated to:

- Integrate the new Protocol Step Editor
- Improve dialog layout and responsiveness
- Handle creation and editing of steps more efficiently
- Provide better user feedback during step editing

### Benefits

These enhancements provide several key benefits:

1. **Improved Usability**: More intuitive and user-friendly interface for creating and managing protocols
2. **Better Data Organization**: Structured approach to managing complex protocol information
3. **Enhanced Safety**: Alert system to warn users about potential issues during protocol execution
4. **Equipment Tracking**: Clear indication of equipment requirements for each step
5. **Parameter Management**: Better organization of step-specific parameters

### Testing

Comprehensive unit tests have been created for all enhanced components:

- `protocol-step-editor.test.tsx`: Tests for the new step editor component
- `protocol-steps-visualization.test.tsx`: Tests for the enhanced visualization component
- `protocol-builder.test.tsx`: Tests for the protocol builder integration

### Documentation

Detailed documentation has been added:

- `frontend/src/features/protocols/README.md`: Comprehensive documentation for the protocol module
- Updated main README.md to highlight the new features

## Remaining Items for Future Implementation

1. **Data Integration**
   - Connect UI to real backend API endpoints
   - Implement data fetching and state management
   - Add proper error handling and loading states

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Protocol comparison functionality
   - Advanced data visualization for experiment results
   - Protocol export and import capabilities
   - Protocol Templates: Support for creating and using protocol templates
   - Protocol Validation Rules: More advanced validation rules for protocol steps
   - Equipment Database: Integration with an equipment database for standardized equipment selection

3. **User Authentication**
   - Role-based access to experiments and protocols
   - Collaboration features for shared protocols
   - User-specific views for "My Protocols/Experiments"

## Conclusion

The experimental data enhancement UI has been successfully implemented, providing a robust foundation for scientists to design, execute, and analyze cryopreservation experiments. The implementation follows modern frontend practices, ensures responsive design, and maintains consistency with the existing application design.

The latest enhancement to the Protocol Designer significantly improves the user experience for creating and managing experimental protocols. The comprehensive step editor, improved visualization, and support for equipment, parameters, and alerts provide researchers with powerful tools for designing precise and reliable protocols.

The routing fixes and deployment configuration updates ensure that all pages, including dynamic routes, are properly accessible in the production environment.
