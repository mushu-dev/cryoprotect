This task is to implement a unified approach that streamlines the import process and leverages the best features from both implementations.\n\n## Current State\n\n- ChEMBL_Integrated_Import.py: Imports from ChEMBL with structured logging, checkpointing, and direct Supabase connections\n- import_pubchem_data_direct.py: Imports from PubChem with parallel processing, batch operations, and direct database connections\n- Several variant scripts with different optimization strategies\n\n## Objectives\n\n1. Create a modular architecture that can handle both data sources with a common interface\n2. Implement robust error handling, checkpointing, and resumability\n3. Enable efficient parallel processing of API requests and database operations\n4. Provide comprehensive progress tracking and reporting\n5. Ensure extensibility for future data sources\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\nSee the detailed implementation plan in UNIFIED_IMPORT_PLAN.md\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. A unified import script with modular architecture\n2. Common interfaces for data sources\n3. Shared transformation logic\n4. Comprehensive error handling\n5. Detailed documentation and usage examples\n6. Tests for core functionality\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Successfully imports data from both ChEMBL and PubChem using the same codebase\n- Demonstrates error resilience with API rate limiting and network issues\n- Supports resumption from checkpoints if interrupted\n- Provides accurate progress tracking with ETA calculations\n- Efficiently utilizes system resources through parallel processing\n- Includes documentation on extending for new data sources","labels":[],"number":243,"title":"Implement unified ChEMBL and PubChem data import pipeline"},{"body":"# Bug Report: Fix get-issue.bat to Use Windows-Native Commands\n\n## Description\nThis issue addresses a bug related to [describe the affected functionality].\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1.
