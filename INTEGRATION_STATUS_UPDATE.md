# CryoProtect Integration Status Update

## Current Status

✅ Main Website: The homepage at https://cryoprotect.app is now successfully loading and rendering
❌ API Endpoints: The API routes (/api/hello and /health) are returning 404 errors
❓ Backend Integration: Not yet tested as API routes are not working

## Progress Made

1. **Fixed Homepage Rendering**:
   - Successfully deployed a simplified version of the website
   - The site now loads and displays the basic content
   - CSS styling is applied properly
   - Navigation does not cause 404 errors

2. **Key Changes Implemented**:
   - Used compatible versions of Next.js (12.3.4) and React (17.0.2)
   - Removed App Router and standardized on Pages Router
   - Disabled Edge Functions to avoid deployment issues
   - Simplified Next.js configuration
   - Fixed netlify.toml configuration

## Remaining Issues

1. **API Routes Not Working**: 
   - The /api/hello endpoint returns a 404
   - The /health endpoint returns a 404
   - We need to check Netlify function logs to diagnose

2. **Backend Integration**:
   - Backend redirection needs to be tested once API routes are working
   - Convex integration still needs to be re-enabled

## Next Steps

1. **Fix API Routes**:
   - Check Netlify function logs for errors
   - Update API route configuration
   - Test simplified API endpoints

2. **Implement Backend Integration**:
   - Test and fix backend redirection
   - Properly configure CORS
   - Test with actual backend endpoints

3. **Re-enable Advanced Features**:
   - Enable Convex integration
   - Restore full UI components
   - Implement authentication

## Technical Implementation Details

We successfully identified and fixed several key issues:

1. **Next.js Version Compatibility**: 
   - Original version had compatibility issues with Netlify's plugin
   - Downgraded to Next.js 12.3.4 which works better with Netlify

2. **Router Configuration**:
   - Removed conflicting App Router code
   - Standardized on Pages Router

3. **Build Configuration**: 
   - Simplified Next.js config
   - Removed problematic experimental features
   - Added trailingSlash: true for better URL handling

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Added NEXT_DISABLE_EDGE_IMAGES=true to avoid Edge Function issues

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress by getting the main website to render correctly. This is a major step forward from the previous 404 error. The next focus area is fixing the API routes, which will enable backend integration testing.
