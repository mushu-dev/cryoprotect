# ChEMBL Import Verification

This document summarizes the verification process for the ChEMBL to Supabase import pipeline and the key findings.

## Overview

We've implemented a verification process to ensure that molecules imported from ChEMBL into our Supabase database maintain their integrity, have all required properties calculated, and are properly cross-referenced with other chemical databases (e.g., PubChem).

## Verification Scripts

Several scripts were created to perform this verification:

1. **`verify_chembl_import_data.py`**: Uses the Supabase Management Console Protocol (MCP) to verify ChEMBL data in the database.
2. **`verify_chembl_direct_fixed.py`**: Uses a direct PostgreSQL connection to verify the data (more reliable).
3. **`check_molecule_counts.py`**: A simpler script to check molecule counts and basic statistics.
4. **`scripts/create_chembl_issues.sh`**: Creates GitHub issues based on the findings.

## Key Findings

Our verification revealed several issues with the ChEMBL import pipeline:

1. **Property Calculation Issues**:
   - While 95.2% of ChEMBL molecules have some form of properties in the database, most are missing several critical molecular properties.
   - Properties like LogP (19 molecules), Molecular Weight (10 molecules), and various bond counts (9 molecules) are present for some molecules.
   - No molecules have JSONB properties populated in the 'properties' field.

2. **Cross-Reference Issues**:
   - Only 4.8% (1 out of 21) ChEMBL molecules have a corresponding PubChem CID.
   - This lack of cross-references limits our ability to combine data from both sources.

3. **Data Schema**:
   - The database schema is properly set up with appropriate tables and columns.
   - The molecular_properties table structure is good but missing a 'method' column that was referenced in some code.

## Database Structure

The database contains 33 tables, including:
- molecules
- molecular_properties
- mixtures
- mixture_components
- cryoprotection_scores
- experiment_properties
- and more

The molecules table has the proper structure for storing ChEMBL molecules, with fields for ChEMBL IDs, PubChem CIDs, SMILES, InChI, etc.

## Recommended Actions

Based on our findings, we've created several GitHub issues to address the problems:

1. **Fix molecular property calculation for ChEMBL imported molecules**
   - Ensure all standard properties are calculated (LogP, TPSA, etc.)
   - Implement a reprocessing script for existing molecules

2. **Implement ChEMBL-to-PubChem cross-reference resolution**
   - Create a robust mapping mechanism between identifiers
   - Populate missing PubChem CIDs for existing ChEMBL molecules

3. **Create data quality validation checks for molecule imports**
   - Implement a validation framework to ensure data integrity
   - Generate data quality reports for batch imports

4. **Optimize molecular property storage using JSONB fields**
   - Migrate property data to use the JSONB 'properties' field
   - Create database functions for efficient property queries

## Connection Configuration

The verification scripts have been configured to connect to the Supabase database using credentials from the environment or `.env` file. The connection parameters are:

```
Host: aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com
Port: 5432
Database: postgres
User: postgres.tsdlmynydfuypiugmkev
Project ID: tsdlmynydfuypiugmkev
```

## Conclusion

The verification process has helped us identify critical issues in our ChEMBL import pipeline. By addressing these issues, we'll ensure that our imported data is complete, accurate, and properly cross-referenced, which will significantly improve the utility of our chemical database for cryoprotectant analysis.
