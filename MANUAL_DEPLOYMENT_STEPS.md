# Manual Deployment Options

Since we're experiencing issues with Vercel authentication, here are manual deployment options that will work:

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest)

Netlify offers a simple drag-and-drop deployment without authentication requirements:

1. Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. Drag and drop the `public_connection_test` folder from your file explorer
3. Netlify will instantly deploy without requiring configuration
4. You'll get a public URL like `https://random-name-123abc.netlify.app`

## Option 2: GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is another excellent free option without authentication:

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push your `public_connection_test` folder contents to the repository
3. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
4. Under "Source", select "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
5. Click "Save"
6. Your site will be available at `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## Option 3: Use Local Connection Test

You don't need to deploy at all to test connectivity:

1. Open this file directly in your browser:
   ```
   file:///home/mushu/Projects/cryoprotect/public_connection_test/index.html
   ```
2. Click "Run Tests" to verify backend connectivity
3. All API tests should succeed if your Heroku backend is correctly configured

## For Frontend Development

When developing your frontend application locally, use these settings regardless of where it's deployed:

```javascript
// API configuration
const API_URL = 'https://cryoprotect-8030e4025428.herokuapp.com';

// Example API request
fetch(`${API_URL}/api/molecules`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Backend API Endpoints

Your backend is already deployed and working correctly:

- Base URL: `https://cryoprotect-8030e4025428.herokuapp.com`
- Health Check: `https://cryoprotect-8030e4025428.herokuapp.com/health`
- API Connect: `https://cryoprotect-8030e4025428.herokuapp.com/api/connect`
- List Molecules: `https://cryoprotect-8030e4025428.herokuapp.com/api/molecules`

You can use these endpoints from any frontend, regardless of where it's hosted.
