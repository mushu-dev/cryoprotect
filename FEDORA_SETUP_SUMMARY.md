# CryoProtect Fedora Setup Summary

This document provides a summary of the actions taken to prepare the CryoProtect project for Fedora OS and outlines the next steps for full integration.

## Actions Completed

1. **Analysis of Project Structure**
   - Identified Windows-specific components
   - Analyzed platform-specific code
   - Reviewed Docker configuration and dependencies

2. **Linux Migration Scripts Created**
   - `run_app_with_fix.sh` - Linux equivalent of Windows batch script
   - `run_tests_conda.sh` - Linux test runner for conda environment
   - `batch_scripts/start_server.sh` - Flask server starter for Linux

3. **Linux Installation Scripts Created**
   - `install_linux_dependencies.sh` - General Linux dependency installer
   - `docker_setup.sh` - Docker installation for Linux
   - `setup_fresh_linux.sh` - Combined installation script

4. **Fedora-specific Scripts Created**
   - `fedora_setup.sh` - Comprehensive Fedora installation script with:
     - System package installation
     - SELinux configuration
     - Firewall setup
     - PostgreSQL configuration
     - Conda environment setup
     - Docker installation (optional)
     - Systemd service creation (optional)
     - Verification steps

5. **Documentation Created**
   - `LINUX_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Guide for migrating from Windows to Linux
   - `FEDORA_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
   - `ROO_FEDORA_SETUP_PROMPT.md` - Comprehensive prompt for Roo integration

## Filesystem Structure Updates

The following updates have been made to ensure compatibility with Fedora's filesystem structure:

1. **Path Separators**
   - All path separators have been standardized to forward slashes (/)
   - Path construction uses os.path.join() for cross-platform compatibility

2. **Executable Permissions**
   - All shell scripts have been made executable with chmod +x
   - Docker entry point script is properly configured

3. **SELinux Contexts**
   - SELinux contexts have been defined for:
     - Application files (httpd_sys_content_t)
     - Log directories (httpd_log_t)
     - Cache directories (httpd_cache_t)
     - Backup directories (httpd_sys_rw_content_t)

## Configuration Files

The following configuration files have been created or modified:

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - `.env` template updated to include Fedora-specific settings
   - Database connection parameters configured for PostgreSQL on Fedora

2. **Docker Configuration**
   - Docker compose file reviewed and compatible with Fedora
   - Dockerfile uses standard Linux paths

3. **Systemd Service**
   - Systemd service file created for running as a system service
   - Configured to start after network and PostgreSQL

## Remaining Tasks for Roo Integration

1. **SELinux Policy Fine-Tuning**
   - Create granular SELinux policy modules for each component
   - Test policy in enforcing mode with all features

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Tune PostgreSQL configuration for Fedora
   - Optimize RDKit memory usage for visualization

3. **Enhanced Security**
   - Implement Fedora-specific security hardening
   - Configure firewalld rich rules for complex networking

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines specific to Fedora
   - Create build validation for Fedora packages

5. **Testing Automation**
   - Create comprehensive test suite that runs on Fedora
   - Verify SELinux and firewall configurations in tests

## Fedora-Specific Considerations

When running CryoProtect on Fedora, be aware of these specific considerations:

1. **SELinux**
   - SELinux is enabled by default on Fedora and must be properly configured
   - Use `semanage` and `restorecon` to manage contexts
   - Custom policy modules may be needed for some functionality

2. **Firewall**
   - Fedora uses firewalld which is more restrictive than Windows Firewall
   - Use `firewall-cmd` to manage port openings
   - Consider creating a dedicated firewall zone for development

3. **PostgreSQL Differences**
   - Fedora's PostgreSQL installation uses different default paths
   - Authentication is stricter by default (peer vs. md5)
   - Data directory is at `/var/lib/pgsql/data`

4. **System Packages**
   - Fedora uses DNF package manager with modularity
   - Some packages have different names than on Ubuntu/Debian
   - Development headers have different package naming patterns

5. **X11 and Graphics**
   - RDKit visualization requires X11 libraries
   - Font rendering may differ from Windows
   - If using Wayland, additional configuration may be needed

## Next Steps

1. Create a `.env` file with your specific configuration
2. Run the `fedora_setup.sh` script to set up your environment
3. Follow the verification steps to ensure everything is working
4. For development, consider using the provided Docker configuration
