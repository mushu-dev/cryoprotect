# Experimental Data Enhancement Status

## Overview

The Experimental Data Enhancement feature adds improved data collection, visualization, and analysis capabilities to the CryoProtect application. This document summarizes the current implementation status and testing infrastructure.

## Implementation Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Basic experiment listing | ✅ Complete | Displays experiments with basic information |
| Experiment detail view | ✅ Complete | Shows basic experiment data |
| Enhanced visualization | ⚠️ In progress | Charts and interactive visualizations |
| Filtering | ⚠️ In progress | Basic filtering functionality |
| Data sorting | ⚠️ In progress | Sorting experiments by various criteria |
| Data comparison | ⚠️ Planned | Comparing multiple experiments |
| Data export | ⚠️ Planned | Exporting experimental data |
| Mobile responsiveness | ✅ Complete | Works on mobile devices |

## Testing Infrastructure

The feature includes a comprehensive testing setup:

1. **End-to-End Tests**: Basic tests that verify core functionality works
   - Located in `/tests/e2e/`
   - Tests basic navigation and experiment display

2. **Feature-Specific Tests**: Detailed tests for individual features
   - Located in `/tests/playwright/`
   - Tests data visualization, API endpoints, and UI components

3. **Validation Scripts**: Scripts to run comprehensive test suites
   - `setup-test-env.sh`: Sets up the testing environment
   - `run-data-tests.sh`: Runs specific data feature tests
   - `validate-experimental-data-enhancement.sh`: Runs complete validation

## Running Tests

```bash
# Set up the test environment
./setup-test-env.sh

# Run basic end-to-end tests
npm run test:experimental-features

# Run specific data feature tests
./run-data-tests.sh

# Run complete validation
./validate-experimental-data-enhancement.sh
```

- [Experimental Data Testing Guide](/EXPERIMENTAL_DATA_TESTING.md): Quick reference for testing
- [Experimental Data Validation Guide](/docs/EXPERIMENTAL_DATA_VALIDATION.md): Detailed validation strategy

## Next Steps

1. Complete implementation of filtering and sorting UI
2. Enhance data visualization components
3. Implement data comparison functionality
4. Add data export capabilities
5. Update tests to align with implemented features

## Conclusion

The Experimental Data Enhancement feature is progressing well, with basic functionality in place and more advanced features in development. The test infrastructure is fully set up and will expand as the feature matures.
