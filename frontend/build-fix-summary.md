# Build Issues Fixed Summary

- Moved from direct named imports like `import { User, Mail } from 'lucide-react'` to properly structured imports
- Created custom icon components in `/components/ui/icons.tsx` for specialized icons not available in Lucide

## 2. NextAuth.js Route Configuration
- Properly exported handler functions in `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- Implemented the `export { handler as GET, handler as POST }` pattern required by Next.js App Router

## 4. Theme Provider Configuration
- Set up theme provider with proper attribute configuration for class-based themes
- Fixed implementation of ThemeProvider component tree order
- Ensured proper client-side rendering with 'use client' directive
- Added transitions disable to prevent theme flashing

## 5. Type Definitions for External Libraries
- Added declaration files for third-party libraries like 3DMol and Plotly
- Defined proper module augmentation for NextAuth session and JWT types
- Created minimal type interfaces for untyped libraries to provide code completion
- Ensured TypeScript compatibility with external libraries using proper declaration syntax
