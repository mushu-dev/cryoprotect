## Task Description
Implement a comprehensive ChEMBL data import and validation system to acquire, transform, and validate chemical compounds from the ChEMBL database for use in the CryoProtect application. The system should handle extraction of compounds with cryoprotectant properties, perform property calculations and standardization, resolve cross-references with PubChem, and validate data integrity throughout the process.

## Current Status
- The basic implementation of the ChEMBL import system is in place via the `unified_chembl_import.py` script
- Initial validation capabilities have been built but require enhancement
- Property standardization has been implemented in separate components
- Database connection issues have been resolved
- Several test imports have been run, but full validation is incomplete

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Obtain compounds with cryoprotectant properties from ChEMBL
   - Implement resilient connection with rate limiting and retry logic
   - Cache results to prevent redundant requests
   - Add checkpoint functionality for resumable imports

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Convert ChEMBL data format to match CryoProtect database schema
   - Standardize property names and units according to established conventions
   - Calculate missing molecular properties using RDKit when available
   - Normalize SMILES representations and molecular formulas

3. **PubChem Cross-Reference Resolution**
   - Resolve ChEMBL IDs to PubChem CIDs for consistent referencing
   - Implement caching to improve performance and reduce API requests
   - Handle conflicts when multiple PubChem records match a ChEMBL compound

4. **Data Validation**
   - Verify structural integrity of imported molecules
   - Validate property data against established ranges
   - Check for duplicate compounds based on InChIKey
   - Generate comprehensive validation reports
   - Implement automatic remediation for common issues

5. **Database Integration**
   - Use connection pooling for efficient database operations
   - Implement batch processing to optimize insert/update operations
   - Temporarily disable RLS during bulk imports for performance
   - Add proper error handling and transaction management

## Challenges and Proposed Solutions

### Challenge 1: ChEMBL API Rate Limiting
**Solution**: Implement adaptive rate limiting with exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern, and request caching.

### Challenge 2: Inconsistent Property Naming
**Solution**: Create a property mapping system that standardizes ChEMBL property names to match our established property_types table. Apply unit conversions where necessary.

### Challenge 3: Missing Molecular Properties
**Solution**: Use the RDKit integration to calculate properties not provided by ChEMBL. Fall back to minimally required properties when RDKit is unavailable.

### Challenge 4: Import Performance
**Solution**: Implement batched processing, connection pooling, and temporarily disable RLS during large imports. Add configurable checkpoint intervals.

### Challenge 5: Validation Completeness
**Solution**: Develop a multi-stage validation pipeline that checks data at extraction, transformation, and loading phases. Create detailed validation reports for review.

## Testing and Validation Approach

### Unit Testing
- Test each component of the import pipeline independently
- Verify property transformations with known reference compounds
- Test PubChem resolution with a range of ChEMBL IDs

### Integration Testing
- Perform end-to-end test with a small set (10-20) of known cryoprotectants
- Verify database insertion, property calculation, and cross-reference resolution
- Test checkpoint and resumption functionality

### Validation Testing
- Run comprehensive validation on a larger test set (100+ compounds)
- Generate validation reports for manual review
- Compare property values with reference data when available
- Verify structural integrity with RDKit validation functions

### Performance Testing
- Benchmark import performance with various batch sizes
- Measure database performance before and after index creation
- Profile memory usage during large imports

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Create basic implementation of unified ChEMBL import script
- [x] Implement property standardization for consistent formatting
- [x] Resolve database connection issues
- [x] Add performance indexes to database schema
- [x] Create test environment for validation
- [ ] Enhance PubChem cross-reference resolution
- [ ] Implement comprehensive validation reports

## Additional Notes
- The import system should be configurable to run in dry-run mode for testing
- Logging should be comprehensive to aid in debugging and auditing
- Consider creating a web interface for viewing validation reports
- All scripts should have proper error handling and provide useful error messages
- Database transactions should be properly managed to prevent partial imports
