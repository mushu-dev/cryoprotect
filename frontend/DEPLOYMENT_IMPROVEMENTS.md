# Frontend Deployment Improvements

This document outlines the recent improvements made to the CryoProtect frontend codebase to ensure smooth deployment and operation in production.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Compatibility

- Added proper client-side checks in profile and settings pages
- Fixed issues with browser-specific objects during SSR
- Ensured safe access to session data with optional chaining (`session?.user?.name`)
- Added safety checks for `window` and `document` objects
- Created multiple build strategies to handle SSR limitations

### 2. Environment Variables Configuration

- Standardized environment variables across development and production
- Updated environment variable documentation
- Created consistent naming conventions for environment variables
- Added built-in fallbacks for missing environment variables

### 3. Deployment Process

- Created deployment scripts for automated Vercel deployment:
  - `deploy-vercel.sh` for the entire project
  - `build-prod.sh` for standard Next.js deployment
  - `build-static.sh` for static HTML export
- Added multiple build options with different tradeoffs
- Included proper secret management for NextAuth.js
- Documented deployment steps and troubleshooting

### 4. Security Improvements

- Updated Content Security Policy in Vercel configuration
- Added secure headers for production deployment
- Implemented proper NEXTAUTH_SECRET generation and storage
- Added documentation on security best practices

### 5. Documentation

- Created comprehensive deployment guide
- Added troubleshooting section for common issues
- Documented environment variable requirements
- Provided step-by-step instructions for different deployment scenarios

### 6. Fixed Deployment Configuration

- Updated Vercel routing configuration to prevent app.py download issue
- Created separate deployment scripts for frontend and backend
- Fixed MIME type handling for Next.js assets
- Added proper route handling for static assets

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "app.py download" Issue

**Problem:** When accessing the frontend website, the browser downloads app.py instead of displaying the website.

**Cause:** The root project's vercel.json configuration contains a catchall route that sends all requests to app.py, which conflicts with the frontend deployment.

**Solution:**
1. We've updated the root vercel.json to include proper routes for frontend static assets:
   ```json
   {
     "src": "^/app.py$",
     "status": 404,
     "dest": "/404.html"
   }
   ```
2. Added specific routing for Next.js assets and files
3. Created separate deployment scripts for frontend and backend
4. Added development script to run both servers locally with proper routing

### Environment Variable Conflicts

**Problem:** Different environment variables between development and production environments cause unexpected behavior.

**Solution:**
1. Standardized environment variable naming across all environments
2. Provided clear documentation on required variables
3. Added fallback values for optional variables
4. Created environment-specific configuration files (.env.development, .env.production)

## Testing & Validation

The improvements have been tested in the following environments:

- Local development with mock data
- Local production build with API integration
- Vercel preview deployments
- Production deployment

## Future Improvements

- Implement automated deployment testing
- Add health check endpoint for monitoring
- Create deployment validation checklist
- Add automated environment variable validation
- Consider creating hybrid rendering approach that works better with authentication
- Implement a fallback mechanism for dynamic routes in static export
- Explore Next.js middleware options for better handling of authentication in static exports
