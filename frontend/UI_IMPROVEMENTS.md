   - Added quick actions for common tasks
   - Implemented cards for recent experiments and top cryoprotectants
   - Added visual data representations

## Implementation Details

### Simplified Component Architecture

To avoid dependencies on external UI libraries, we've created simplified versions of common UI components:

- **Button**: Various styles (default, outline, ghost, destructive)
- **Card**: Content containers with consistent styling
- **Dialog**: Modal windows for focused interactions
- **Sheet**: Slide-out panels for mobile navigation
- **Form Controls**: Inputs, textareas, selects, and toggles
- **Typography**: Consistent text styling and headings

### Tailwind CSS Integration

The UI system leverages Tailwind CSS for:

- Consistent spacing and sizing
- Responsive design patterns
- Color scheme management
- Component variants
- Dark/light mode support

### Accessibility Improvements

- Added proper ARIA labels to interactive elements
- Improved keyboard navigation support
- Ensured sufficient color contrast
- Added screen reader text for icons

## Testing

We've created comprehensive UI tests using Playwright to ensure components render correctly and interactions work as expected. Run the tests with:

```bash
./run-ui-test.sh
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Theme Customization**
   - Add a theme switcher for light/dark mode
   - Allow customization of primary/secondary colors

2. **Animation**
   - Add subtle animations for state changes
   - Improve transitions between pages

3. **Component Extensions**
   - Add more specialized scientific components
   - Create data visualization components specific to cryoprotectant analysis

4. **Design System Documentation**
   - Expand the component library documentation
   - Add usage guidelines for developers
