# Convex Implementation Roadmap

This document provides a step-by-step roadmap for completing the Convex integration across both frontends of the CryoProtect application.

## Phase 1: Unified Configuration (Completed ✅)

- ✅ Create unified Convex client configuration
- ✅ Implement shared ConvexProvider component
- ✅ Create shared data fetching hooks
- ✅ Update Netlify deployment configuration
- ✅ Create development environment setup script
- ✅ Test Convex connectivity end-to-end

## Phase 2: Component Migration (Next Steps)

### Week 1: Core Data Access Services

1. **Create Directory Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p \
     /home/mushu/Projects/cryoprotect/minimal-frontend/src/services/molecules \
     /home/mushu/Projects/cryoprotect/minimal-frontend/src/services/mixtures \
     /home/mushu/Projects/cryoprotect/minimal-frontend/src/services/timeout \
     /home/mushu/Projects/cryoprotect/minimal-frontend/src/components/circuit-breaker \
     /home/mushu/Projects/cryoprotect/minimal-frontend/src/hooks
   ```

2. **Migrate Molecule Service**
   - Adapt TypeScript service to JavaScript if needed
   - Ensure compatibility with minimal frontend architecture
   - Update API endpoints

3. **Migrate Mixture Service**
   - Follow same approach as molecule service
   - Update for compatibility

4. **Test Data Access Services**
   - Create simple test scripts for each service
   - Verify fetching from both API and Convex

### Week 2: Resilience Components

1. **Migrate Circuit Breaker**
   - Adapt to JavaScript if needed
   - Update error handling for minimal frontend

2. **Migrate Timeout Service**
   - Implement configurable timeouts
   - Integrate with circuit breaker

3. **Add Logging/Monitoring**
   - Implement basic logging
   - Add health checks

4. **Test Resilience Features**
   - Verify circuit breaker functions
   - Test timeout behavior
   - Validate error handling

### Week 3: UI Components and Hooks

1. **Migrate Molecule UI Components**
   - Implement molecule list component
   - Create molecule card component
   - Add molecule viewer component

2. **Migrate Mixture UI Components**
   - Implement mixture list component
   - Create mixture card component

3. **Migrate Hook Components**
   - Implement use-molecules hook
   - Create use-mixtures hook
   - Test with both data sources

4. **Update Pages**
   - Modify existing pages to use new components
   - Add loading states
   - Implement error handling

### Week 4: Testing and Refinement

1. **Create Comprehensive Tests**
   - End-to-end testing scripts
   - Unit tests for critical components
   - Integration tests

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching
   - Add connection pooling
   - Optimize rendering

3. **Documentation**
   - Update component documentation
   - Create developer guides
   - Add code comments

4. **Final Review**
   - Cross-frontend compatibility check
   - Ensure consistent behavior
   - Verify all features work identically

## Phase 3: Production Deployment

1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Verify configuration works
   - Test with production-like data

2. **Production Deployment Plan**
   - Create deployment checklist
   - Plan rollback strategy
   - Schedule deployment

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement production monitoring
   - Set up alerting
   - Create dashboards

4. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Verify functionality in production
   - Monitor performance
   - Address any issues

## Working with This Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to be executed in sequence, with each phase building on the previous one. The phases are broken down into weekly tasks to provide a manageable implementation schedule.

Key points to remember:

1. **Always test after each component migration**: Ensure each component works as expected before moving to the next
2. **Maintain compatibility with both the API and Convex**: All components should work with either data source
3. **Follow the unified configuration approach**: Use the shared configuration for consistency
4. **Document as you go**: Add comments and documentation during implementation
5. **Keep both frontends in sync**: Any critical fixes should be applied to both frontends
