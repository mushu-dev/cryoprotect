## Key Dependencies and Critical Path

1. Connection pool optimization must be completed before full load testing
2. Security definer functions must be implemented before updating RLS policies
3. JWT token manager must be completed before implementing enhanced authentication
4. Toxicity schema optimization must be done before creating materialized views

## Risk Management

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Connection pool settings cause resource exhaustion | Medium | High | Implement strict upper bounds and monitoring |
| RLS policy changes break existing access patterns | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing of all access patterns before deployment |
| JWT implementation introduces security vulnerabilities | Low | High | Security review by dedicated security team |
| Schema migration causes data loss | Low | High | Create comprehensive backups and test migration in staging |
| Performance optimizations cause regressions | Medium | Medium | A/B testing of old vs. new implementation |
