| Optimized RLS Policies | ❌ Failed |
| Complex Query Optimization | ❌ Failed |
| Verification | ❌ Failed |

## Overview
This report documents the optimization of complex query patterns with Row-Level Security (RLS) 
policies in the CryoProtect database. The optimizations improve query performance
while maintaining the security guarantees provided by RLS.

## Optimization Details

### Security Definer Functions
Security definer functions were implemented to optimize common access patterns.
These functions run with elevated privileges but enforce security checks internally,
reducing the overhead of repetitive RLS policy evaluations.

### Performance Indexes
Specialized indexes were added to support efficient execution of RLS policies and complex queries.
These indexes target the columns commonly used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses.

### Materialized Views
Materialized views were created for frequently accessed data combinations.
These views pre-compute complex joins and aggregations to improve query performance.

### Optimized RLS Policies
The RLS policies were updated to leverage the security definer functions and
performance indexes, reducing query planning and execution time.

### Complex Query Optimization
Specialized functions and indexes were created for common complex query patterns:
- Property range queries
- Full-text search queries
- Molecule-with-properties queries
- Mixture-with-components queries

## Performance Test Results

| Query Pattern | Original (ms) | Optimized (ms) | Improvement (%) | Speedup Factor |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|

## Verification Results
### Issues Found
- Error during verification: Failed to parse query result: 

## Implementation Details

### Security Definer Functions
The following functions were implemented:
- `has_molecule_access(molecule_id)`: Checks if the current user has access to a molecule
- `has_mixture_access(mixture_id)`: Checks if the current user has access to a mixture
- `is_team_member(team_id)`: Checks if the current user is a member of a team
- `user_has_clearance(required_level)`: Checks if the current user has the required clearance level
- `find_molecules_by_property_range(property_name, min_value, max_value)`: Finds molecules with a property value in a range
- `search_molecules_text(search_term)`: Searches molecules by name and description text
- `filter_accessible_molecules(molecule_ids)`: Filters a list of molecule IDs to those accessible by the current user
- `get_molecules_with_properties(limit_count, offset_val)`: Gets molecules with their property counts
- `get_mixtures_with_components(limit_count, offset_val)`: Gets mixtures with their component counts

### Query Performance Optimization Techniques
1. **Security Definer Functions**: Reduce policy evaluation overhead
2. **Materialized Views**: Pre-compute common access patterns
3. **Specialized Indexes**: Support specific query patterns
4. **Covering Indexes**: Include all columns needed for a query
5. **Function-Based Indexes**: Support queries with expressions
6. **Partial Indexes**: Optimize for specific WHERE conditions
7. **Text Search Indexes**: Optimize full-text search
8. **Optimization of RLS Policies**: Simplify policy expressions

## Next Steps
1. Monitor query performance with the optimized policies
2. Set up scheduled refresh of materialized views
3. Analyze slow queries in production
4. Tune indexes based on actual usage patterns
5. Add query result caching for frequently-accessed data
6. Consider additional optimizations for specific access patterns
