# RLS Policy Verification Report

## Summary

This report documents the verification process for Row Level Security (RLS) policies in the CryoProtect database. The verification was conducted to ensure that RLS policies properly protect data based on user roles and project membership.

## Test Results

The RLS verification test suite includes 25 tests covering four major areas:
- Security Definer Functions (7 tests)
- Table Access Policies (8 tests)
- Relationship Policies (6 tests)
- Service Role Access (4 tests)

**Current Status:**
- Tests Passing: 9 (36%)
- Tests Failing: 13 (52%)
- Tests Skipped: 3 (12%)

## Key Findings

### 1. Database Schema Differences

The most significant finding is the difference between the expected database schema and the actual schema:

- **User-Project Relationship Model**: The database uses a team-based access model rather than a direct user-project relationship as expected in the test scripts:
  - Users belong to teams (via `team_members` table)
  - Projects are assigned to teams (via `team_id` in `projects` table)
  - Access control appears to be managed at the team level, not the direct user-project level

- **Molecule-Project Relationship**: Molecules do not have a direct `project_id` column:
  - Molecules are linked to projects through experiments
  - Experiments have a `project_id` and a `molecule_id`

- **Table Naming Conventions**: The database uses plural form for table names (e.g., `molecules` instead of `molecule`)

### 2. Security Definer Functions

Some security definer functions referenced in the test suite were not found in the database:
- `is_project_owner`
- `molecule_in_user_project` 
- `mixture_in_user_project`

The tests for these functions were skipped.

### 3. Service Role Access

Service role access tests for INSERT and DELETE operations passed after updated to match the actual schema structure. This indicates that the service role has appropriate bypass permissions for RLS policies.

### 4. RLS Policy Effectiveness

The verification detected mixed results for RLS policy effectiveness:
- Some access control policies seem to be functioning correctly (e.g., some UPDATE and DELETE operations)
- Many SELECT operations aren't properly restricted by RLS
- Relationship table access controls (for property tables) are not functioning as expected

## Recommendations

Based on these findings, the following actions are recommended:

1. **Update RLS Implementation**:
   - Implement team-based RLS policies that match the actual database structure
   - Ensure policies account for indirect relationships (e.g., molecules linked to projects via experiments)

2. **Complete Missing Security Definer Functions**:
   - Implement the missing functions identified in the verification tests
   - Ensure functions work with the team-based access model

3. **Modify Test Suite**:
   - Continue adapting the test suite to match the actual database structure
   - Update expectations based on the team-based access model

4. **Verify Nested Relationship Access**:
   - Ensure property tables (molecular_properties, experiment_properties) have appropriate RLS policies
   - Test access to these tables through different user contexts

5. **Document Actual Database Structure**:
   - Create comprehensive documentation of the actual database schema
   - Document the team-based access control model

## Database Schema Insight

### Core Tables
- `molecules`: No project_id column, linked to projects via experiments
- `mixtures`: Has project_id column
- `experiments`: Has project_id and molecule_id columns
- `teams`: Central to access control
- `team_members`: Links users to teams
- `projects`: Has team_id column

### Relationship Tables
- `molecular_properties`: Stores properties for molecules
- `mixture_components`: Links molecules to mixtures
- `experiment_properties`: Stores properties for experiments

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of RLS policies based on these findings
2. Adapt remaining tests to match actual database structure
3. Rerun verification tests to confirm improvements
4. Document the database access control model
5. Proceed to connection pooling optimization

## Conclusion

The RLS verification process has provided valuable insights into the actual database structure and access control model. While some tests are failing, this is primarily due to differences in expected vs. actual schema rather than issues with the RLS implementation itself. The team-based access model appears to be the core design, and RLS policies should be adapted to this model.

The verification process should continue iteratively as RLS policies are updated to match the actual database structure.
