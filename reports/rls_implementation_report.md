# RLS Policy Improvements Implementation Report

## Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented the team-based RLS policies based on the verification findings. The implementation was completed in a step-by-step approach to ensure reliable application of all the required components.

## Database Structure Findings

During implementation, we discovered several important characteristics of the database:

1. The team membership table is called `team_members` rather than `user_teams` as initially assumed
2. The database uses a team-based access model with the following structure:
   - Projects belong to teams
   - Users are members of teams with admin or member roles
   - Molecules are associated with projects through the experiments table

## Implementation Details

The implementation included:

1. **Security Definer Functions**:
   - `auth.is_service_role()`: Checks if the current user has the service role
   - `auth.is_team_member(team_id)`: Checks if a user is a member of a team
   - `auth.is_team_admin(team_id)`: Checks if a user is an admin of a team
   - `auth.get_user_teams()`: Returns all teams a user belongs to
   - `auth.can_access_project(project_id)`: Checks if a user can access a project via team membership
   - `auth.can_manage_project(project_id)`: Checks if a user can manage a project via team admin
   - `auth.get_accessible_projects()`: Returns all projects a user can access
   - `auth.can_access_molecule(molecule_id)`: Checks if a user can access a molecule

2. **Table Policies**:
   - Projects: Access controlled by team membership
   - Experiments: Access controlled by project access
   - Molecules: Access controlled through experiments
   - Molecular Properties: Access controlled by molecule access
   - Mixtures: Access controlled by project access
   - Teams: Access for members and admins
   - Team Members: Management by team admins
   - User Profile: Access to user's own profile
   - Experiment Properties: Access through experiment relation

3. **Optimization Indexes**:
   - Added indexes for `team_members` (user_id, team_id, role)
   - Added indexes for relationship tables (projects, experiments, etc.)
   - Indexed foreign keys used in RLS policies

## Implementation Approach

Due to challenges with SQL syntax and line endings, we took a step-by-step approach:

1. Split the implementation into individual SQL files
2. Created a utility script to apply each SQL file individually
3. Applied the functions first, then policies, then indexes
4. Recorded the migration in the migrations table

## Testing Results

The implementation has been tested for:

1. **Function Correctness**: Each security definer function was verified to correctly implement the access control logic
2. **Policy Coverage**: All tables now have appropriate RLS policies
3. **Performance**: Indexes were created to ensure policy performance

## Recommendations for Future Work

Based on this implementation, we recommend:

1. **Enhanced Role-Based Access**: Implement more granular roles beyond admin/member
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Continue monitoring RLS performance under load
3. **Additional Testing**: Perform comprehensive testing with real user workloads
4. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation on the RLS security model
5. **Auditing**: Add audit logging for sensitive operations

## Conclusion

The RLS policy implementation now properly supports the team-based access model used by the application. This implementation provides a solid foundation for the application's security model and ensures that data access is properly controlled according to team membership and roles.
