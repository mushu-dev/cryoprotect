# CryoProtect Deployment Fix

This directory contains scripts and configuration files to fix the frontend-backend integration issues in the CryoProtect application.

## Current State

We've successfully deployed a minimal version of the application that:
- Resolves correctly to the cryoprotect.app domain
- Has working API endpoints (/api/hello and /health)
- Has functioning Netlify serverless functions

However, the main Next.js application is falling back to a static page, indicating that the server-side rendering is failing.

## Files in this Repository

- **FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_FIXES.md**: Comprehensive plan for fixing the integration issues
- **frontend/next.config.js.fixed**: Updated Next.js configuration
- **frontend/package.json.fixed**: Updated package.json with compatible dependencies
- **frontend/netlify.toml.fixed**: Updated Netlify configuration
- **frontend/deploy-netlify-fixed.sh**: Script to deploy the fixed frontend
- **monitor-deployment.sh**: Script to monitor the deployment and check endpoints

## Root Causes and Solutions

1. **Next.js Compatibility**: We've downgraded to Next.js 12.3.4 and React 17.0.2, which work better with Netlify.
2. **Router Conflicts**: Removed App Router and standardized on Pages Router.
3. **Build Configuration**: Simplified Next.js configuration and removed problematic settings.
4. **Plugin Configuration**: Pinned plugin version to 4.30.4, which is known to work.
5. **Environment Variables**: Simplified environment variables and disabled complex integrations initially.

## How to Deploy

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-netlify-fixed.sh
   ```

3. Monitor the deployment:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ./monitor-deployment.sh
   ```

## Incremental Approach

This fix uses a phased approach:
1. First, deploy a working basic version with simplified configuration
2. Verify that the core Next.js application loads properly
3. Gradually add back features like Convex integration
4. Test with each addition to identify issues

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
- Check Netlify Function logs in the Netlify dashboard
- Look for Next.js build errors in the deployment logs
- Verify DNS configuration
- Test each backend service independently
- Consider temporarily disabling Edge Functions with `NEXT_DISABLE_EDGE_IMAGES=true`

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. Implement full Convex database integration
2. Restore molecule, mixture, and experiment views
3. Enable authentication system
4. Complete API integration
5. Add comprehensive error handling
