# Rationale for v0.1.0 Architectural Changes

Version 0.1.0 introduces significant breaking changes to the `rooroo` agent architecture. These changes were driven by several key goals aimed at improving the system's simplicity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

## 1. Simplicity and Separation of Concerns

*   **Problem:** The previous `Master Orchestrator` role was monolithic, handling everything from high-level goal interpretation and planning to detailed task delegation, state monitoring, and user interaction. This broad scope could lead to complex internal logic and made the agent's responsibilities less clear.
*   **Solution:** We split the orchestrator into two distinct roles:
    *   **`Strategic Planner`:** Focuses solely on the initial, complex phase of understanding the user's goal, decomposing it into a high-level plan and specific tasks, and setting up the initial state (`project_overview.json`, `.state/tasks/`). This requires significant reasoning capabilities.
    *   **`Workflow Coordinator`:** Focuses on the procedural execution phase. It monitors the state, delegates ready tasks according to the plan, manages interactions related to task execution (like test prompts), and updates the state based on outcomes. This is a more reactive and state-driven role.
*   **Benefit:** This separation makes each agent's role clearer and simpler to understand and maintain. It aligns responsibilities more effectively â€“ strategic thinking vs. procedural execution management.

## 2. Avoiding Overlap with Built-in IDE Capabilities

*   **Problem:** The dedicated `Apex Implementer` agent was responsible for writing code, tests, and performing refinements. However, modern IDE extensions (like Roo Code itself, GitHub Copilot, etc.) often provide increasingly sophisticated built-in `code` generation and `debug` capabilities, sometimes using highly optimized or specialized models.
*   **Solution:** We removed the `Apex Implementer` specialist agent. The `Workflow Coordinator` now delegates implementation, bug fixing, and test execution tasks directly to the IDE's built-in `code` and `debug` modes.
*   **Benefit:** This avoids functional redundancy. It leverages potentially faster, cheaper, or more context-aware coding tools integrated directly into the development environment. It also simplifies the `rooroo` agent crew further.

## 3. Cost Savings and Resource Optimization

*   **Problem:** Running a powerful, expensive LLM (like GPT-4 or Claude Opus) for the entire duration of a project, including the more procedural aspects of coordination handled by the old `Master Orchestrator`, can be costly.
*   **Solution:** The Planner/Coordinator split allows for targeted use of different LLM tiers:
    *   The `Strategic Planner` handles the most complex reasoning (planning, decomposition) and is the primary candidate for a **smart/expensive LLM**.
    *   The `Workflow Coordinator` handles more procedural tasks (monitoring state, delegating based on rules, simple user interactions) and can often effectively use a **fast/cheap LLM**.
    *   Specialist agents (`Architect`, `UX Specialist`, `Validator`, `DocuCrafter`) can be assigned LLMs based on the complexity of their specific tasks (e.g., Architect might need a smarter LLM, Validator might not).
    *   Delegating coding to built-in modes leverages the cost structure of those specific tools.
*   **Benefit:** This architecture enables significant potential cost savings by using powerful models only for the phases that genuinely require them, without sacrificing quality in planning or design.

These changes represent a strategic evolution of `rooroo`, aiming for a leaner, more efficient, and adaptable orchestration system.
