# Configuring Vercel Authentication Settings

By default, Vercel may apply authentication protection to personal account projects. To disable this and make your deployment publicly accessible, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Transfer to a Vercel Team

1. **Create a Vercel Team**:
   - Go to [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
   - Select "Create Team"
   - Follow the prompts to create a free team

2. **Transfer Your Project**:
   - Go to your project settings
   - Click on "General"
   - Scroll down to find "Transfer Project"
   - Select your newly created team
   - Confirm the transfer

3. **Redeploy Your Project**:
   - Once transferred, your project should automatically be publicly accessible
   - If not, make a small change and redeploy

## Option 2: Disable Authentication in Project Settings

1. **Go to Project Settings**:
   - Navigate to your project on Vercel
   - Click on "Settings" tab

2. **Find Authentication Settings**:
   - Look for "Authentication" or "Password Protection" section
   - Toggle it off or disable it

3. **Verify Changes**:
   - Save your settings
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Test public access to your site

## Option 3: Use Environment Variables to Control Authentication

Add a `VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS=1` environment variable to your project:

1. **Go to Project Settings** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**
3. **Add New Variable**:
   - Name: `VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS`
   - Value: `1`
   - Environment: Production
4. **Redeploy** your project

## Using Vercel CLI to Deploy Without Authentication

For CLI deployments, you can add the `--public` flag:

```bash
vercel --prod --public
```

Or update your Vercel project configuration:

```json
{
  "public": true
}
```

## Testing Your Deployment

After applying these changes, test your deployment by:

1. Opening your site in an incognito/private browser window
2. Accessing it from a different device
3. Checking if API endpoints are publicly accessible

Your Vercel deployment should now be accessible without authentication requirements.
