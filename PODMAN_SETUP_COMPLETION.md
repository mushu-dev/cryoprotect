# Podman Container Setup Completion Report

## Summary

We have successfully set up two Podman container options for the CryoProtect project:

1. **Simplified Container with Mock RDKit** - Fully working and tested
2. **Comprehensive Conda Container** - Created but requires time to complete

Both solutions address the SELinux permission issues that were encountered previously.

## Completed Work

### Simplified Container
- Created `simplified_container_setup.sh` to set up a lightweight Python container
- Implemented mock RDKit functionality for testing
- Created helper scripts for running commands in the container
- Configured Flask application to test basic functionality
- Successfully tested with `test_mock_rdkit.py`
- Container runs on port 5001

### Comprehensive Conda Container
- Created `create_cryoprotect_conda_container.sh` to set up a full conda environment
- Implemented proper SELinux context handling for volumes
- Created helper scripts for running commands, mounting files, and running the application
- Designed for full RDKit functionality
- Installation takes significant time (30+ minutes)

### SELinux Integration
- Used proper context labeling for mounted volumes
- Implemented container security options
- Created helper functions to handle SELinux permissions
- Documented SELinux considerations and fixes

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `PODMAN_CONDA_SETUP.md`
- Created `CRYOPROTECT_CONTAINER_SUMMARY.md` with usage instructions
- Added helpful scripts and test cases

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simplified Container | ✅ Working | http://localhost:5001 |
| Mock RDKit | ✅ Working | Tests pass |
| Conda Container | ⏳ Created, installing | Takes time to complete |
| SELinux Integration | ✅ Working | No permission errors |

## How to Use

### Simplified Container
```bash
# Set up the container
./simplified_container_setup.sh

# Run the test script
podman cp test_mock_rdkit.py CryoProtect-Slim:/app/
podman exec -it CryoProtect-Slim bash -c "cd /app && python test_mock_rdkit.py"

# Access the API
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

### Full Conda Container
```bash
# Set up the container (takes time)
./create_cryoprotect_conda_container.sh

# Once completed, run commands
./run_in_cryoprotect.sh "python -c 'import rdkit; print(rdkit.__version__)'"

# Mount project files and run the app
./mount_project_in_container.sh
./run_app_in_container.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Conda Environment Installation**
   - The conda environment will take time to install all dependencies
   - Check progress with: `podman logs CryoProtect`

2. **Test Full Application**
   - Once conda environment is ready, run the full application
   - Test all features with real RDKit

3. **Set Up Systemd Services**
   - Set up systemd services for automatic container startup
   - Configure health checks for monitoring

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Use the multi-stage Dockerfile for production deployment
   - Implement proper volumes for data persistence

## Troubleshooting

### Container Not Accessible
- Check if the container is running: `podman ps`
- Check container logs: `podman logs CryoProtect-Slim`
- Check port usage: `sudo lsof -i :5001`

### SELinux Permission Issues
If you encounter permission issues:
```bash
# For one-time fix
chcon -Rt container_file_t /path/to/volume

# For persistent fix
semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t "/path/to/volume(/.*)?"
restorecon -Rv /path/to/volume
```

### Slow Conda Installation
Conda installation can take 30+ minutes due to RDKit and other scientific packages:
- Check progress with `podman logs CryoProtect`
- For quick testing, use the simplified container instead
