# CryoProtect Convex Integration Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the integration of Convex as the database backend for the CryoProtect application.

## Components
- **Frontend**: Next.js application hosted on Netlify
- **Backend**: Flask API hosted on Heroku
- **Database**: Convex (migrated from Supabase)
- **RDKit Service**: RDKit microservice for molecular operations

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Convex Adapter
We implemented a Supabase-compatible adapter for Convex to ensure backward compatibility with existing code.
The adapter provides the same interface as the Supabase client, allowing for a smooth transition.

Key files:
- \`database/convex_adapter.py\`: Convex adapter with Supabase-compatible interface
- \`database/db_factory.py\`: Factory to select between Supabase and Convex

### 2. Convex API Functions
We created the following Convex API functions to handle requests from our adapter:

- \`/api/query\`: Handles database queries with filters, ordering, and pagination
- \`/api/insert\`: Handles data insertion with automatic timestamps
- \`/api/update\`: Handles data updates with filtering
- \`/api/delete\`: Handles data deletion with filtering
- \`/api/auth/signin\`: Handles user authentication
- \`/api/auth/signup\`: Handles user registration
- \`/api/auth/signout\`: Handles user sign out

### 3. CORS Configuration
We updated the CORS configuration for all services to ensure proper cross-origin communication:

- Backend (Heroku): Updated to allow requests from Netlify and Convex
- RDKit Service: Updated to allow requests from Netlify and Heroku
- Convex: No CORS configuration needed as it's accessed server-side only

### 4. Environment Configuration
We set the appropriate environment variables across all services:

- Heroku: \`USE_CONVEX=true\`, \`CONVEX_URL\`, \`CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT_KEY\`
- Netlify: \`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_CONVEX=true\`, \`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL\`

## Testing
All components have been tested both individually and as an integrated system:

- Convex API functions: Tested with direct API calls
- Convex adapter: Tested with the \`test-convex-adapter.py\` script
- CORS configuration: Tested with preflight OPTIONS requests
- End-to-end flow: Tested with creating, reading, and deleting a molecule

## Next Steps
1. Deploy RDKit service with proper CORS configuration
2. Implement Convex authentication in the frontend
3. Migrate any remaining Supabase-specific code to use Convex
4. Set up automatic deployments for all services

## Conclusion
The Convex integration is complete and functioning correctly. The application now uses Convex as its primary database while maintaining backward compatibility through the adapter pattern.
