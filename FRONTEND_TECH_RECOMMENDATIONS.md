    molecules/
      components/
      hooks/
      utils/
      types.ts
      api.ts
    mixtures/
      components/
      hooks/
      utils/
      types.ts
      api.ts
  shared/
    components/
    hooks/
    utils/
    types/
  lib/
    supabase.ts
    axios.ts
    auth.ts
  styles/
  app/
    (routes)
```

**Rationale:**
- Organizes code by domain/feature
- Easier to understand and navigate
- Better code splitting possibilities
- Clear boundaries between features
- Easier to maintain and extend

### Data Fetching Pattern: React Query with Service Layer

**Recommendation:**

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Data Handling

1. **Virtualization for large lists**
   - Use react-virtual or react-window for molecule lists
   - Only render visible items for improved performance

2. **Pagination for API data**
   - Implement cursor-based pagination for efficiency
   - Use React Query's built-in pagination helpers

3. **Incremental loading for complex data**
   - Load essential data first, then details
   - Skeleton loaders for improved UX

### Rendering Optimization

1. **Code splitting**
   - Route-based code splitting with Next.js
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components like molecular viewers

2. **Memoization**
   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - useMemo for expensive calculations
   - useCallback for stable callbacks

3. **Lazy loading**
   - Defer loading off-screen content
   - Use Intersection Observer for visibility detection
