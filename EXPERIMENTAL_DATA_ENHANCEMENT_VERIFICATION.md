# Experimental Data Enhancement UI Verification

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

1. **Homepage** ✅
   - Feature cards for Molecules, Mixtures, Experiments, and Protocols
   - Navigation to all key sections
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Confirmed working via direct testing

2. **Experiments Page** ✅
   - List of experiment cards with metadata
   - Create New Experiment button
   - Filtering and search capabilities
   - Status indicators for each experiment
   - Confirmed working via direct testing

3. **Protocols Page** ✅
   - List of protocol cards with metadata
   - Create New Protocol button
   - Tab system for All/My/Templates categories
   - Protocol version indicators
   - Confirmed working via direct testing

### Components with Issues

1. **Experiment Detail Pages** ❌
   - Currently returning 404 errors
   - UI is implemented but appears to have routing issues
   - Next steps: Fix the dynamic routing for experiment detail pages

2. **Protocol Detail Pages** ❌
   - Currently returning 404 errors
   - UI is implemented but appears to have routing issues
   - Next steps: Fix the dynamic routing for protocol detail pages

## Verification Process

1. **Direct HTTP Testing**
   - Used Node.js HTTPS module to fetch and verify page content
   - Confirmed homepage, experiments list, and protocols list are working
   - Identified 404 errors on detail pages

2. **UI Elements Verification**
   - Homepage has feature cards with proper links
   - Experiments page has experiment cards with expected content
   - Protocols page has protocol cards with expected content
   - Navigation between pages is functioning correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Dynamic Routing**
   - Investigate routing configuration in `next.config.js`
   - Check dynamic route handling in page components
   - Ensure proper fallback behavior for dynamic routes

2. **Complete Detail Page Functionality**
   - Once routing is fixed, implement any missing UI elements
   - Ensure proper data loading for individual experiment/protocol details
   - Add edit/delete functionality to detail pages

3. **Add Create Pages**
   - Implement experiment creation wizard
   - Implement protocol builder interface
   - Add validation and form submission handling

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement data visualization components for experiment results
   - Add protocol step visualization
   - Implement protocol comparison functionality

## Conclusion

The experimental data enhancement UI implementation is partially complete. The main list pages are functioning correctly, but detail pages need routing fixes. The overall structure and components are in place, following the design requirements in the experimental data enhancement plan.
