# Phase 3.1: Deployment Infrastructure - Optimization Strategy

To maximize efficiency and minimize API costs in implementing Phase 3.1, we've created a comprehensive optimization strategy that includes line-specific guidance for targeted file access.

## Key Optimization Techniques

### 1. Line-Specific File Access

When working with large files, request only the specific line ranges containing code that needs modification rather than the entire file. For example:

```
View file: Dockerfile, lines 10-25
```

This approach significantly reduces token usage and lets agents focus precisely on the code that matters.

### 2. Batch Similar Tasks

Group similar changes across multiple files to reduce context switching:

- Process all CI/CD workflow files together
- Update Docker configuration files in one batch
- Implement environment configuration in a unified session

### 3. Implementation Templates

Use the provided code patterns as implementation templates to avoid unnecessary experimentation:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow pattern
name: CI Pipeline
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Additional steps...
```

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage Dockerfile pattern
FROM python:3.9-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip wheel --no-deps --wheel-dir /app/wheels -r requirements.txt

FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/wheels /wheels
# Additional steps...
```

### 4. Progressive Implementation

1. Start with CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions files)
2. Then update Docker configuration (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
3. Next implement environment configuration (config.py and variants)
4. Finally add deployment scripts (bash scripts)

This approach ensures visible progress while building a solid foundation.

## Resource Usage Protocol

1. First check `PHASE_3.1_LINE_REFERENCES.md` for specific line locations
2. Only load the exact line ranges needed
3. Make focused, specific changes
4. Update the line references document as you complete tasks

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Assessment**: Check line references to identify areas needing work
2. **Loading**: Load only the specific line ranges
3. **Implementation**: Make targeted changes to those lines
4. **Testing**: Test the specific component modified
5. **Documentation**: Update resources to reflect completed work

## API Cost Minimization

To minimize API costs:
- Never search for files that are already mapped in the resource guide
- Use the exact line ranges provided rather than loading full files
- Batch similar modifications together
- Leverage the provided code patterns rather than creating new ones
- Update the line references document as you work to keep it current

## Cost-Efficient Testing

For testing CI/CD and deployment:
- Use dry-run options when available
- Test Docker builds locally before pushing
- Validate scripts with static analysis first
- Use mock environments for deployment testing

By following this optimization strategy, we can complete Phase 3.1 with minimal token usage while maintaining high quality implementation.
