# Phase 2.3: UI Enhancement Optimized Implementation

You're implementing the UI Enhancement phase (Phase 2.3) of CryoProtect v2. I've provided comprehensive resources including exact line references to make your work highly efficient and cost-effective.

## Key Resources - Review These First

1. **PHASE_2.3_RESOURCE_GUIDE.md** - Maps all files and resources
2. **PHASE_2.3_LINE_REFERENCES.md** - Specific line numbers for targeted modifications
3. **PHASE_2.3_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md** - Strategy for efficient implementation
4. **PHASE_2.3_IMPLEMENTATION_DIRECTIVE.md** - Specific tasks with priorities

## Implementation Approach

For maximum efficiency, follow this approach:

1. **Targeted File Access**
   - Request only the specific line ranges mentioned in PHASE_2.3_LINE_REFERENCES.md
   - Example: "View file: integrated-molecular-viewer.js, lines 577-607"

2. **Batched Modifications**
   - Group similar tasks across multiple files
   - Process all responsive layouts together
   - Handle all accessibility enhancements in one batch

3. **Focus Areas**
   - Responsive layouts for remaining templates
   - Finalize integrated molecular viewer (key issues on specific lines)
   - Complete keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes
   - Enhance user experience workflows

## Example of Optimized Workflow

```
1. Check LINE_REFERENCES.md for specific lines to modify
2. Request only those line ranges: "View file X, lines 100-150"
3. Make targeted changes using the provided code patterns
4. Test the specific component modified
5. Document the changes and move to the next area
```

## Token Usage Optimization

- Never search for files already mapped in the resources
- Only load the specific line ranges you need to modify
- Use the provided code patterns rather than creating new ones
- Update the line references document as you progress

By using these precise line references and focused approach, you'll minimize token usage while maximizing productivity. All the information you need has been mapped and organized - you just need to focus on implementation.

When you've completed the implementation, provide a summary of what was accomplished and which files were updated.
