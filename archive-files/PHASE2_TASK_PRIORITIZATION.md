# Phase 2 Task Prioritization Guide

This document provides a prioritized roadmap for implementing Phase 2 tasks, with detailed reasoning for the prioritization and dependencies between tasks.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Critical foundation - Must be completed first as other tasks depend on it
- **P1**: High priority - Essential functionality with few dependencies
- **P2**: Medium priority - Important but can be worked on in parallel with P1
- **P3**: Lower priority - Should be completed after higher priorities

## Week 1: Essential Maintenance Utilities

| Task | Priority | Dependencies | Reasoning |
|------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1.1: Foreign Key Fixes (Migration Script) | P0 | None | Creating the migration script is the foundation for database integrity |
| 1.1: Foreign Key Fixes (Apply Script) | P1 | 1.1 Migration | Need the migration script first before it can be applied |
| 1.2: RLS Implementation (Migration) | P1 | None | Can be worked on in parallel with foreign key fixes |
| 1.2: RLS Implementation (Apply Scripts) | P2 | 1.2 Migration | Need the migration script first |
| 1.3: Database Health Check Module | P2 | None | Independent module that can be developed in parallel |
| 1.3: Database Health API Endpoints | P3 | 1.3 Module | Depends on the health check module |
| 1.4: Backup Enhancements | P2 | None | Independent feature that can be developed in parallel |
| 1.4: Restore Functionality | P3 | 1.4 Backup | Restore depends on backup implementation |

## Critical Implementation Path

The following sequence represents the critical path for implementing Phase 2:

### Week 1
1. Foreign Key Migration Script → Foreign Key Apply Script
2. RLS Migration Script → RLS Apply Scripts
3. Database Health Check Module → Health Check API
4. Backup Enhancements → Restore Functionality

### Week 2
1. Core Prediction Algorithms → Validation Framework + Model Training
2. Core Prediction Algorithms → Visualization Components
3. Model Training → Model Persistence → Model API

### Week 3
1. GitHub Actions Test → GitHub Actions Build → GitHub Actions Deploy
2. Enhanced Error Logging → Performance Metrics → Basic Alerts
3. Deployment Scripts → GitHub Actions Deploy
4. Health Checks → Basic Alerts

## Task Dependencies Graph

```

1.1 FK Migration → 1.1 FK Apply
1.2 RLS Migration → 1.2 RLS Apply
1.3 Health Module → 1.3 Health API
1.4 Backup → 1.4 Restore

Week 2:
2.1 Core Algorithms → 2.2 Validation
2.1 Core Algorithms → 2.3 Visualization
2.1 Core Algorithms → 2.4 Training → 2.4 Persistence → 2.4 API

Week 3:
3.1 Test → 3.1 Build → 3.1 Deploy
4.1 Logging → 4.2 Metrics → 4.4 Alerts
3.3 Scripts → 3.1 Deploy
4.3 Health → 4.4 Alerts
```

## Parallelization Opportunities

Several tasks can be worked on in parallel to optimize the development process:

### Parallel Track 1: Database Foundations
- 1.1 Foreign Key Fixes
- 1.2 RLS Implementation

### Parallel Track 2: Maintenance Utilities
- 1.3 Database Health Check
- 1.4 Backup/Restore

### Parallel Track 3: Predictive Models
- 2.1 Core Algorithms
- 2.3 Visualization (after 2.1)

### Parallel Track 4: Model Infrastructure
- 2.2 Validation Framework (after 2.1)
- 2.4 Model Training/Persistence (after 2.1)

### Parallel Track 5: DevOps
- 3.1 GitHub Actions
- 3.3 Deployment Scripts

### Parallel Track 6: Monitoring
- 4.1 Error Logging
- 4.3 Health Checks

## Risk Mitigation

To minimize implementation risks, consider these mitigation strategies:

### Database Integrity Risks
- Create database backups before applying migrations
- Add rollback procedures to each migration
- Test migrations on a staging environment first

### Predictive Models Risks
- Implement model versioning from the start
- Create test datasets for validation
- Add fallback mechanisms for prediction failures

### CI/CD Risks
- Test workflow changes on a separate branch
- Implement staging deployments before production
- Add rollback capabilities to deployment scripts

### Monitoring Risks
- Start with conservative alert thresholds
- Implement alert suppression for known issues
- Create documentation for alert response procedures

## Conclusion

By following this prioritized implementation plan, the Roo PM agent can efficiently implement Phase 2 while managing dependencies and mitigating risks. The critical path provides a clear sequence for implementation, while the parallelization opportunities allow for optimizing development resources.
