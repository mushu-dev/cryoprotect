# ROO Master Orchestrator - Database Population Directive

## Priority Directive: Database Population Implementation

The Master Orchestrator should coordinate the immediate implementation of our comprehensive database population strategy. You are operating on a Sunday, which has higher PubChem API rate limits, so prioritize PubChem data integration after addressing any critical ChEMBL integration issues.

### Current Context

1. We have completed the schema design and migration preparation
2. The initial ChEMBL integration has been implemented but requires optimization
3. PubChem integration code exists but needs to be executed at scale
4. Mixture and experiment population scripts have been created but not fully verified
5. Today (Sunday) offers optimal conditions for PubChem API usage

### Task Sequence (High to Low Priority)

1. **Critical ChEMBL Remediation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
   - Execute `chembl_remediation_main_fixed.py` to fix DDL execution issues via MCP
   - Verify the `chembl_id` column has been added to the molecules table
   - Ensure reference compounds (CHEMBL25, CHEMBL1118, etc.) are properly imported

2. **PubChem Data Import (SUNDAY OPPORTUNITY)**
   - Launch `PubChem_CryoProtectants_Supabase_Enhanced.py` with increased batch size
   - Set API delay parameter to optimal value (0.15s) to leverage Sunday rate limits
   - Target 5,000+ compounds with complete property profiles

3. **Mixture and Component Generation**
   - Execute `populate_mixtures.py` and `populate_mixture_components.py`
   - Verify mixture components sum to correct concentrations
   - Ensure diverse mixture compositions based on cryoprotectant principles

4. **Experiment and Prediction Creation**
   - Run `populate_experiments.py` with realistic experimental parameters
   - Execute `populate_predictions.py` linked to appropriate calculation methods
   - Verify coverage across molecule and mixture entities

5. **Verification and Optimization**
   - Run comprehensive verification using `verify_database_population.py`
   - Apply performance indexes via `apply_performance_indexes.py`
   - Generate final population report with statistics and validation results

## MCP Integration Requirements

All database operations must use MCP via the following patterns:

1. **DDL Operations**
```python
# Pattern for DDL statements
sql = "SELECT execute_ddl('ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name VARCHAR;') as result;"
result = execute_sql(sql, project_id)
```

2. **SELECT Operations**
```python
# Pattern for SELECT statements
sql = "SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition;"
result = execute_sql(sql, project_id)
```

3. **INSERT Operations**
```python
# Pattern for INSERT statements
sql = f"INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES ('{value1}', '{value2}') RETURNING id;"
result = execute_sql(sql, project_id)
```

4. **UPDATE Operations**
```python
# Pattern for UPDATE statements
sql = f"UPDATE table_name SET column1 = '{value1}' WHERE condition RETURNING id, column1;"
result = execute_sql(sql, project_id)
```

## Error Handling Protocol

1. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors
   - Log rate limit encounters in dedicated file
   - Resume from last checkpoint after waiting period

2. **Database Errors**
   - Log detailed error information including SQL statement
   - Categorize errors (constraint violation, permission, etc.)
   - Continue processing with next batch when possible

3. **Validation Errors**
   - Log skipped/invalid entities with reason codes
   - Generate aggregate statistics on validation failures
   - Flag critical validation failures for human review

## Coordination Requirements

1. **Checkpointing**
   - Each agent must maintain checkpoint files
   - Use timestamp-based naming convention
   - Serialize progress in JSON format with metadata

2. **Progress Reporting**
   - Generate progress reports every 15 minutes
   - Include completion percentage and ETA
   - Flag any blocking issues that require intervention

3. **Dependency Management**
   - ChEMBL remediation must complete before PubChem import
   - Mixture population depends on molecule data
   - Experiments and predictions depend on mixtures and calculation methods

## Sunday PubChem Optimization

Take advantage of Sunday's higher PubChem API rate limits with the following specific optimizations:

1. **Rate Parameter Adjustment**
   - Default PUBCHEM_API_DELAY: 0.2s
   - Sunday optimized PUBCHEM_API_DELAY: 0.15s
   - Monitor 429 responses and adjust dynamically if needed

2. **Batch Size Enhancement**
   - Default batch_size: 50
   - Sunday optimized batch_size: 100
   - Adjust based on memory usage monitoring

3. **Expanded Target**
   - Default target: 2,000 compounds
   - Sunday optimized target: 5,000+ compounds
   - Focus on complete property profiles

4. **Parallelization Strategy**
   - Run PubChem import and ChEMBL remediation concurrently if possible
   - Split CID list into segments for parallel processing
   - Consolidate results from parallel processes

## Success Criteria

The database population directive will be considered successfully completed when:

1. **Volume Requirements**
   - 10,000+ molecules with complete property profiles
   - 500+ mixture definitions with components
   - 200+ experiments with parameters
   - 1,000+ predictions with calculation methods

2. **Data Quality**
   - All reference compounds present and verified
   - Properties reconciled against authoritative sources
   - Mixtures follow scientific composition principles
   - Experiments reflect realistic parameters

3. **Performance**
   - Query response time <500ms for common operations
   - Indexes applied for frequent access patterns
   - Batch operations complete within reasonable timeframes

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive population report generated
   - Statistics on entity counts and relationships
   - Validation results documented with error rates
   - Optimization recommendations provided

## Reporting Instructions

Generate the following artifacts upon completion:

1. **Master Population Report**
   - Summary of all populated entities
   - Statistics on data sources (ChEMBL vs PubChem)
   - Validation results and error rates
   - Performance measurements

2. **Entity Relationship Diagram**
   - Visual representation of populated data
   - Relationship cardinality statistics

   - Caching strategies for frequent lookups
   - Partitioning recommendations for large tables

4. **API Integration Examples**
   - Code snippets for accessing populated data
   - Example queries for common operations
   - Performance best practices

## Time Allocation

Given the Sunday opportunity for PubChem optimization:

1. **ChEMBL Remediation**: 2 hours maximum
2. **PubChem Integration**: 4-6 hours (take advantage of Sunday limits)
3. **Mixture Generation**: 2 hours
4. **Experiment Population**: 2 hours
5. **Verification and Optimization**: 2 hours

## Final Instructions

1. Prioritize task execution based on the sequence provided
2. Take full advantage of Sunday's higher PubChem API rate limits
3. Maintain detailed logs and checkpoints throughout execution
4. Generate comprehensive reports for each completed task
5. Ensure all operations use MCP for database interaction
6. Verify success criteria are met before marking tasks complete

The Master Orchestrator should delegate these tasks to specialized agents while maintaining overall coordination. Report significant milestones and any blocking issues that require human intervention.
