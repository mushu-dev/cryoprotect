## Current Focus

**Current Focus: Database Population with Scientific Data**
- Database population is foundational for all other project aspects
- ChEMBL integration is the priority during weekdays (better API limits)
- Worker Pool implementation will be leveraged for parallel processing
- Data quality is critical for scientific validity

## Critical Dependencies

1. **Database Population**: Must be completed before:
   - UI testing at scale
   - Performance optimization
   - User acceptance testing
   - Documentation finalization

2. **Docker Configuration**: Must be completed before:
   - CI/CD pipeline can fully deploy
   - Blue/Green deployment implementation
   - Production environment setup

3. **Security Implementation**: Must be completed before:
   - Public deployment
   - User onboarding
   - Handover to operations team

## Schedule

- Database Population: April 28 - May 5, 2025
- Deployment Infrastructure Completion: May 7, 2025
- Monitoring and Maintenance: May 8-14, 2025
- Security Implementation: May 15-21, 2025
- Documentation and Handover: May 22 - June 4, 2025

## Implementation Approach

Each phase and task will follow these implementation principles:

1. **Micro-Task Architecture**: Tasks limited to <100 lines of change
2. **Specialized Roles**: Each task assigned to a specialist in that domain
3. **Clear Dependencies**: Explicit tracking of task dependencies
4. **Context Efficiency**: Minimal context required for each task
5. **Reference-Based Implementation**: Use existing patterns where possible

## Success Metrics

- Test coverage: 90%+
- Code quality rating: A
- Accessibility: 90%+
- Performance (90th percentile):
  - Page load: <1s
  - API responses: <500ms
  - Database queries: <200ms
- Documentation completeness: 95%+

This master plan provides the high-level roadmap for the project. Refer to phase-specific plans for detailed implementation guidance.
