# CryoProtect v2 Optimized Roo Code Implementation Plan

## Current Status Analysis
We are in Phase 2 (Feature Completion), with parts of Phase 1 still needing work. The project now uses a direct Claude Code CLI and Roo Code approach for efficient, cost-effective task management and implementation.

## Roo Code Optimization Strategy

### 1. Structured Task Delegation Approach

#### Primary Chat (This Chat)
- **Purpose**: Project management, progress monitoring, task planning
- **Focus**: High-level oversight, task delegation, integration points
- **Key Activities**: 
  - Monitor overall progress
  - Create specific, focused task definitions
  - Review completed work
  - Resolve integration issues

#### Specialized Task Chats
Create separate, focused chats for each major component:

1. **API Standardization Chat**
   - Focused on API endpoint standardization only
   - Clear boundaries: Response formats, status codes, documentation

2. **Database Module Chat**
   - Focused on database operations, migrations, and verification
   - No overlap with API implementation

3. **Testing Framework Chat**
   - Focused solely on testing infrastructure, fixtures, and coverage
   - Separated from implementation work

4. **Core Features Chat**
   - Implementation of specific features (predictive models, protocol designer)
   - Targeted implementation with clear deliverables

### 2. Cost Optimization Techniques

1. **Precise Task Definitions**
   - Create detailed task specifications with clear boundaries
   - Include exactly what's in scope and out of scope
   - Provide explicit acceptance criteria

2. **Token Efficiency**
   - Use Claude Code for code-heavy tasks
   - Use Claude Opus for planning/design tasks
   - Leverage batch operations for related changes

3. **Context Management**
   - Limit file scope for each task
   - Use context efficiently with selective file loading
   - Clear task boundaries to prevent scope creep

### 3. Implementation Priority Matrix

Focus on high-impact, moderate-effort tasks first:

| Priority | Task Area | Impact | Effort | Dependencies |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | API Standardization | High | Medium | None |
| 2 | Core Models Implementation | High | Medium | API Standardization |
| 3 | Test Coverage Improvement | High | Medium | None |
| 4 | Protocol Designer | Medium | Medium | API Standardization |
| 5 | Export/Sharing | Medium | Low | API Standardization |
| 6 | UI Improvements | Medium | High | Core Features |
| 7 | Deployment Pipeline | Low | Medium | All Features |
| 8 | Documentation | Low | Low | All Features |

## Immediate Action Plan

### Week 1: Framework Optimization

#### Day 1-2: Task Definition and Setup
1. Create detailed task definitions for:
   - API standardization
   - Database module consolidation
   - Test framework improvement
   - Core predictive models

2. Set up dedicated Roo chats with proper context for each task area

#### Day 3-5: Implementation Kickoff
1. Begin API standardization work
2. Start test framework improvements
3. Initiate database module consolidation

### Week 2-3: Core Functionality

1. Complete API standardization
2. Implement core predictive models
3. Continue test coverage improvement
4. Begin protocol designer implementation

### Week 4-5: Integration and Refinement

1. Complete protocol designer implementation
2. Implement export/sharing functionality
3. Integrate all components
4. Begin UI improvements

## Task Template for Roo Code Delegation

```
# Task: [SPECIFIC TASK NAME]

## Objective
[SINGLE, CLEAR OBJECTIVE]

## Context
- Current status: [BRIEF STATUS]
- Related components: [LIST SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Files involved: [LIST SPECIFIC FILES]

## Requirements
1. [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT 1]
2. [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT 2]
3. [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT 3]

## Constraints
- Out of scope: [WHAT NOT TO MODIFY]
- Dependencies: [WHAT THIS DEPENDS ON]
- Integration points: [WHERE THIS CONNECTS]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [MEASURABLE CRITERIA 1]
- [MEASURABLE CRITERIA 2]
- [MEASURABLE CRITERIA 3]

## Testing Requirements
- [SPECIFIC TESTS TO CREATE/MODIFY]

## Documentation Requirements
- [SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION NEEDED]
```

## Progress Tracking

We will use this main chat to:
1. Define new tasks
2. Review completed tasks
3. Resolve integration issues
4. Update overall progress
5. Adjust the implementation plan as needed

For each task, we'll create a progress entry with:
- Task name and ID
- Status (Not Started, In Progress, Under Review, Completed)
- Start/End dates
- Issues/Blockers
- Next steps

## Cost Efficiency Guidelines

1. **Avoid Task Overlap**: Ensure each task has clear boundaries with no overlap
2. **Minimize Context Loading**: Only load necessary files for each task
3. **Batch Similar Changes**: Group related changes to minimize context switching
4. **Clear Exit Criteria**: Define when a task is truly "done"
5. **Optimize Tool Usage**: Use the right Anthropic model for each task type
6. **Regular Progress Reviews**: Monitor task completion and adjust as needed

## Pilot Task: API Standardization

Let's start with a focused task for API standardization as our first optimized Roo Code task:

```
# Task: API Response Format Standardization

## Objective
Create a consistent response format for all API endpoints

## Context
- Current status: Inconsistent response formats across endpoints
- Related components: api/resources.py, api/models.py
- Files involved: api/resources.py, api/schemas.py, api/utils.py

## Requirements
1. Create a standard response envelope with consistent fields
2. Implement error response standardization
3. Update existing endpoints to use the standard format
4. Add proper HTTP status code usage

## Constraints
- Out of scope: Changing API functionality or database queries
- Dependencies: None
- Integration points: Must work with existing error handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- All API responses follow the same structure
- Error responses contain consistent fields
- HTTP status codes are used appropriately
- No functionality is broken

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for response format
- Integration tests for API endpoints

## Documentation Requirements
- Document standard response format
- Update API documentation with examples
```

With this optimized approach, we'll make significant progress while maintaining cost efficiency and clear task boundaries.
