# CryoProtect PubChem Import Progress Tracking

## Overview

The enhanced `PubChem_CryoProtectants_Supabase_Enhanced.py` script provides real-time, detailed progress tracking for the PubChem cryoprotectant import process. It features a web-based dashboard for live monitoring, as well as persistent progress tracking that survives script restarts.

## Features

- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time progress, batch info, time metrics, and logs at `http://localhost:<port>/`
- **Overall Progress**: X/Y compounds processed, percentage complete
- **Batch Info**: Current batch, total batches, compounds in batch
- **Time Metrics**: Elapsed time, estimated time remaining, average time per batch
- **Success/Failure Stats**: Successful imports, skipped compounds, errors
- **Current Status**: Running, paused, completed, error
- **Persistent Checkpoint**: Progress is saved and restored via `checkpoint.json`
- **Recent Logs**: Last 50 log messages shown in dashboard

## How to Use

1. **Install Requirements**:
   ```
   pip install supabase flask python-dotenv
   ```

2. **Set up your `.env` file** with Supabase credentials.

3. **Run the script**:
   ```
   python PubChem_CryoProtectants_Supabase_Enhanced.py --batch-size 50 --checkpoint checkpoint.json --resume
   ```

4. **Open the dashboard**:
   - The script will print the dashboard URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`)
   - Open it in your browser to monitor progress in real time.

5. **Resume or Reset**:
   - Use `--resume` to continue from the last checkpoint.
   - Use `--reset` to start over and clear previous progress.

## Interpreting the Dashboard

- **Progress Bar**: Shows % of total compounds processed.
- **Current Batch**: Which batch is being processed and how many compounds are in it.
- **Time Metrics**: Elapsed time, estimated time left, and average batch time.
- **Success/Failure**: Number of successful imports, skipped compounds, and errors.
- **Status**: Indicates if the process is running, paused, completed, or errored.
- **Recent Logs**: Shows the latest events, warnings, and errors.

## Issues & Considerations

- The dashboard auto-refreshes every 2 seconds.
- If the script is interrupted, progress is saved and can be resumed.
- The dashboard is only available while the script is running.
- For large datasets, browser performance may degrade if too many log messages are shown (limited to 50).
- Ensure Supabase credentials and network access are correct.

## Deliverables

- `PubChem_CryoProtectants_Supabase_Enhanced.py` (enhanced script)
- Web dashboard (integrated in the script)
