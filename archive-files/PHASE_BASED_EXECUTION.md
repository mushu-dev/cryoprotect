## Process Steps

### 1. Phase Assignment
- Each phase is assigned as a complete unit
- The phase PM handles all work within the phase
- Clear phase boundaries and deliverables are defined
- The phase PM has autonomy within the phase

### 2. Phase Execution
- The phase PM breaks down the work as needed
- Implementation happens within the phase context
- All related tasks are completed within the phase
- The phase PM maintains continuity throughout

### 3. Phase Completion & Check-in
- When the phase is complete, report back to the primary chat
- Review phase deliverables and achievements
- Determine if we're ready to move to the next phase
- Capture any lessons or insights for future phases

## Revised Phases

### Phase 1: Essential Core Functionality (4 Weeks)
- **Lab Verification Workflow Implementation** (1.5 weeks)
  - Design and implement `LabVerification` class (Lines: api/models.py:200-250)
  - Create database migration for lab verification (Lines: migrations/013_lab_verification_schema.sql:1-50)
  - Implement API resources for lab verification (Lines: api/lab_verification_resources.py:1-100)
  - Add frontend components for verification (Lines: static/js/verification.js:1-200)
  - Create tests for verification workflow (Lines: tests/test_lab_verification.py:1-150)

- **API Architecture Standardization** (1 week)
  - Standardize `api/resources.py` (Lines: entire file)
  - Standardize `api/mixture_analysis_resources.py` (Lines: entire file)
  - Standardize `api/rdkit_resources.py` (Lines: entire file)
  - Standardize remaining resource files (Lines: various)

- **Testing Framework Completion** (1 week)
  - Complete Test Data Fixtures (Lines: tests/fixtures/data_fixtures.py:1-100)
  - Update Conftest (Lines: tests/conftest.py:50-100)
  - Verify test coverage (Lines: run_coverage.py:1-50)
  - Fix test failures (Lines: various)

- **Critical Bug Fixes** (0.5 weeks)
  - Address any blocking issues
  - Ensure core workflow functions properly

### Phase 2: Minimal Viable Deployment (3 Weeks)
- **Essential Maintenance Utilities** (1 week)
  - Foreign key relationship fixes
  - RLS implementation tools
  - Database health check utilities
  - Basic backup/restore tools

- Advanced security features
- Knowledge transfer materials
- Video tutorials

## Benefits of Phase-Based Execution

1. **Focus**: Complete concentration on one coherent area
2. **Autonomy**: Phase PM can organize work optimally
3. **Efficiency**: Minimize context switching between phases
4. **Clarity**: Clear completion criteria for each phase
5. **Simplicity**: Straightforward handoffs between phases

## Phase Transition Criteria

### To Complete Phase 1 (Essential Core Functionality)
- Lab verification workflow fully implemented and tested
- API architecture standardized across all resource files
- Testing framework complete with >80% coverage
- No critical bugs in core functionality

### To Complete Phase 2 (Minimal Viable Deployment)
- Essential maintenance utilities functioning
- Predictive models complete and validated
- CI/CD pipeline operational
- Basic monitoring in place

### To Complete Phase 3 (Essential Documentation)
- All README files standardized and accurate
- API documentation complete
- Essential user documentation available
- Deployment guides verified

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 implementation
2. Focus on lab verification workflow first
3. Report progress weekly
4. Transition to Phase 2 once Phase 1 criteria are met
