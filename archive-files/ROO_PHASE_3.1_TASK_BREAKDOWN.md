# ROO PHASE 3.1 TASK BREAKDOWN

## Overview
This document provides a detailed breakdown of Phase 3.1 (Deployment Infrastructure) tasks for the CryoProtect v2 project, to be executed in a strictly linear fashion by the ROO Code Project Manager.

## Task 3.1.1: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

### Task Brief

**Background:**  
The project currently lacks a full CI/CD pipeline. A basic `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file exists but needs significant enhancements. We need to create a robust pipeline that automates testing, building, and deployment.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1. **Complete `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:**
   - Add comprehensive testing steps that run before deployment
   - Configure environment-specific deployment logic (dev/staging/prod)
   - Implement version tagging based on git tags
   - Add deployment notifications via email or Slack

2. **Create `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:**
   - Set up pull request validation workflow
   - Implement code quality checks using flake8/pylint
   - Add security scanning for vulnerabilities
   - Configure test coverage reporting

3. **Documentation:**
   - Document all pipeline triggers and stages
   - Create troubleshooting guide for common pipeline issues
   - Document how to add new deployment targets

**Agent Assignment:**  
DevOps Engineer with GitHub Actions experience

**Dependencies:**  
None

**Resources:**
- Existing `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- GitHub Actions documentation
- Project test suite in `tests/` directory

## Task 3.1.2: Docker Configuration Optimization

### Task Brief

**Background:**  
The current Docker setup is basic and not optimized for production. The Dockerfile needs refactoring to improve security, performance, and resource utilization.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1. **Refactor `Dockerfile`:**
   - Implement multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime environments
   - Optimize layer caching to improve build speed
   - Reduce final image size by removing unnecessary dependencies
   - Configure proper user permissions (avoid running as root)

2. **Enhance `docker-compose.yml`:**
   - Configure proper networks and volumes for production
   - Add resource constraints (CPU, memory limits)
   - Implement container health checks
   - Set appropriate restart policies
   - Add logging configuration

3. **Create variants for different environments:**
   - `docker-compose.dev.yml` for development
   - `docker-compose.blue-green.yml` for blue/green deployment

**Agent Assignment:**  
DevOps Engineer with Docker expertise

**Dependencies:**  
Task 3.1.1: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

**Resources:**
- Existing `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- Docker best practices documentation
- Project requirements for resources and networking

## Task 3.1.3: Environment Configuration Standardization

### Task Brief

**Background:**  
The project uses multiple configuration files for different environments, leading to inconsistencies. We need a standardized approach to manage environment-specific configurations.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1. **Refactor `config.py`:**
   - Create a base `Config` class with common settings
   - Implement environment-specific config classes (Development, Staging, Production)
   - Add proper environment variable loading with validation
   - Implement configuration schema validation

2. **Create comprehensive `.env.template`:**
   - Add all required environment variables with descriptions
   - Include commented default values for development
   - Group variables by functionality (database, auth, API, etc.)
   - Add validation hints (data types, formats)

3. **Update application to use new configuration:**
   - Modify `app.py` to load the correct configuration based on environment
   - Implement configuration validation at startup
   - Add configuration documentation to project README

**Agent Assignment:**  
Backend Engineer with Python expertise

**Dependencies:**  
Task 3.1.2: Docker Configuration Optimization

**Resources:**
- Existing `config.py` and `config_production.py`
- Python dotenv documentation
- Flask configuration best practices

## Task 3.1.4: Blue/Green Deployment Implementation

### Task Brief

**Background:**  
The project needs a zero-downtime deployment strategy for production. Blue/green deployment will allow us to deploy new versions without service interruption and enable quick rollbacks if issues arise.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1. **Design deployment scripts:**
   - Create `scripts/deploy-blue-green.sh` for blue/green deployment
   - Implement `scripts/health-check.sh` for verification
   - Create `scripts/rollback.sh` for emergency rollbacks

2. **Implement deployment logic:**
   - Set up environment preparation steps
   - Configure container deployment with versioning
   - Add comprehensive health checking before traffic switching
   - Implement gradual traffic shifting
   - Add monitoring integration for deployment tracking

3. **Configure Nginx for traffic routing:**
   - Set up Nginx configuration for blue/green switching
   - Implement proper cache management during transitions
   - Configure health check endpoints

4. **Documentation:**
   - Create detailed deployment procedures
   - Document rollback processes
   - Provide troubleshooting guide for common issues

**Agent Assignment:**  
DevOps Engineer with deployment expertise

**Dependencies:**  
Task 3.1.3: Environment Configuration Standardization

**Resources:**
- Existing `nginx/` directory
- `docker-compose.blue-green.yml` from Task 3.1.2
- Scripts directory structure

## Implementation Strategy

1. Execute tasks in strict linear order (3.1.1 → 3.1.2 → 3.1.3 → 3.1.4)
2. Complete verification of each task before beginning the next
3. Ensure comprehensive documentation for each component
4. Validate all implementations with practical tests

## Success Metrics

- CI/CD pipeline runs successfully for all PRs and deployments
- Docker image size reduced by at least 30%
- Configuration management standardized across environments
- Deployment can be performed with zero downtime
- Rollback can be completed in under 5 minutes
