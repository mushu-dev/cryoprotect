# ROO DATABASE POPULATION FOCUS DIRECTIVE

## Overview

This directive focuses specifically on completing the database population tasks that have been partially implemented but not fully verified. The project has implemented database adapter patterns, connection management, and Supabase integration, but database population verification has failed repeatedly due to connectivity issues. We need to ensure the database is properly populated with thousands of molecules with complete properties.

## Current Status

- ✅ Database Connection Architecture (Adapter Pattern)
- ✅ Database Utility Functions
- ✅ Scripts Refactoring
- ✅ Core Import Scripts Ready
- ❌ Database Connection Verification
- ❌ Full Database Population
- ❌ Data Verification

## Success Criteria

The database population implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Database contains at least 5,000 molecules with complete property data
2. All reference compounds (9) are present with complete properties
3. Cross-references between PubChem and ChEMBL are properly established
4. All molecules have complete basic information (name, formula, molecular weight, etc.)
5. All molecules have comprehensive property data (LogP, H-bond donors/acceptors, etc.)
6. Database queries perform effectively with the larger dataset
7. Visualization works with the imported molecules
