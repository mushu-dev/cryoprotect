# Phase 3.1: Deployment Infrastructure - Database-First Approach

## Task Overview

This prompt focuses on implementing Phase 3.1 (Deployment Infrastructure) for CryoProtect v2 using a database-first approach. The implementation will happen in two distinct stages:

1. **Stage 1: Database Preparation & Security** - Configuring and securing the Supabase database
2. **Stage 2: Deployment Infrastructure** - Implementing CI/CD, Docker configuration, and blue/green deployment

This approach ensures we have a properly configured database before proceeding with deployment infrastructure.

## Critical Database Requirements

**The Supabase database currently has missing RLS policies and requires population with scientific data.** This must be addressed as the highest priority before proceeding with general deployment infrastructure tasks.

### Database Tasks (Stage 1)

#### 1.1 Implement Missing RLS Policies

Use the Supabase MCP tool to execute the SQL file that implements the missing RLS policies. You must:

- Use `supabase_mcp_tools.py` to execute the `/mnt/c/Users/1edwa/Documents/CryoProtect v2/supabase_rls_policies.sql` script
- Verify successful implementation by checking for the expected tables and policies
- Handle any errors that might occur during execution
- Use the service role credentials in `.env` to perform this operation

The SQL script implements RLS for:
- experiment_with_results
- migrations
- mixture_with_components
- molecule_with_properties

It also creates a comprehensive scientific data audit system and performance indexes for RLS policies.

#### 1.2 Configure Database Population

Configure the environment for database population:

- Ensure service role authentication is properly set up in `.env`
- Review and enhance the `populate_database_supabase.py` script
- Implement a transaction-safe approach to data population
- Verify scientific data entity relationships

#### 1.3 Populate Scientific Data

Populate the database with required scientific data:

- Populate molecules, mixtures, and experiments with scientifically accurate data
- Use transactions for atomicity
- Implement verification to ensure data integrity
- Use bypass_audit during bulk loading for performance

#### 1.4 Verify Database Configuration

Create comprehensive verification scripts:

- Verify RLS effectiveness with multiple user roles
- Test data access patterns
- Measure query performance with RLS
- Validate scientific data relationships

### Deployment Infrastructure Tasks (Stage 2)

Only proceed to Stage 2 after successfully completing Stage 1.

#### 2.1 CI/CD Implementation

Implement a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:

- Create GitHub workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
- Implement testing automation
- Set up deployment stages
- Configure environment variable management

#### 2.2 Docker Configuration Optimization

Optimize Docker configuration for production:

- Enhance Dockerfile with multi-stage builds
- Optimize Docker image size and security
- Implement proper health checks
- Configure Docker Compose for production

#### 2.3 Environment Configuration

Standardize environment configuration:

- Create `.env.template` for required variables
- Implement environment-specific configuration loading
- Secure sensitive credentials
- Document environment setup requirements

#### 2.4 Blue/Green Deployment

Implement blue/green deployment strategy:

- Create deployment scripts
- Implement zero-downtime updates
- Configure database-aware deployments
- Set up rollback mechanisms

## Implementation Files

### Core Files for Database Tasks

- `/mnt/c/Users/1edwa/Documents/CryoProtect v2/supabase_rls_policies.sql` - RLS policies implementation
- `/mnt/c/Users/1edwa/Documents/CryoProtect v2/supabase_mcp_tools.py` - Supabase MCP tool for executing SQL
- `/mnt/c/Users/1edwa/Documents/CryoProtect v2/populate_database_supabase.py` - Database population script
- `.env` - Environment configuration with service role credentials

### Core Files for Deployment Tasks

- `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration for the application
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment workflow

## Implementation Plan

1. **Database First**:
   - Implement RLS policies via MCP
   - Configure and enhance database population
   - Populate database with scientific data
   - Verify database configuration

2. **Then Deployment**:
   - Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions
   - Optimize Docker configuration
   - Standardize environment configuration
   - Implement blue/green deployment

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Priority**: Database tasks MUST be completed successfully before proceeding to deployment tasks
- **Transactions**: Use database transactions for all data operations
- **Service Role**: Use service role for database administration tasks
- **Verification**: Include verification after each major implementation step
- **Documentation**: Update README files with implementation details
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging

## Success Criteria

1. RLS policies are successfully implemented and verified
2. Database is populated with necessary scientific data
3. CI/CD pipeline is working with automated testing
4. Docker configuration is optimized for production
5. Environment configuration is standardized
6. Blue/green deployment is implemented for zero-downtime updates
