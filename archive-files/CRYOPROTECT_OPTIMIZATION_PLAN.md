# CryoProtect Optimization Plan

This is the central plan document for the CryoProtect project optimization phase, consolidating all required tasks, strategies, and endpoints.

## Current Status

We've successfully completed the initial phase of database optimizations:

- ✅ Created security definer functions for RLS performance
- ✅ Optimized core RLS policies for molecules, mixtures, and components
- ✅ Added performance indexes for frequently accessed columns
- ✅ Created materialized views for commonly queried data
- ✅ Implemented a robust migration framework
- ✅ Added comprehensive data integrity validation

## Primary Objectives

1. **RLS Performance Optimization** - Enhance complex Row Level Security policies for improved query speed
2. **Connection Pool Management** - Configure and fine-tune database connection pooling
3. **Service Role Authentication** - Replace service role workarounds with proper JWT authentication
4. **Toxicity Data Integration** - Complete implementation and optimization of toxicity data features

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Connection Pool Optimization (High Priority)

- [ ] Configure connection pool parameters in config.py
- [ ] Implement robust connection retry logic
- [ ] Add connection timeout handling and circuit breaker
- [ ] Develop logging and metrics for connection usage
- [ ] Stress test connection pool under various load scenarios

### 2. Complete RLS Optimization (High Priority)

- [ ] Apply unified service role policy to all remaining tables
- [ ] Schedule materialized view refresh at appropriate intervals
- [ ] Add explain analyze capabilities to query monitoring
- [ ] Optimize toxicity data query performance
- [ ] Add performance test suite for RLS policies

### 3. Enhance Service Role Authentication (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Create proper JWT-based authentication for service role
- [ ] Remove direct service role references in application code
- [ ] Implement scoped access tokens for specific operations
- [ ] Enhance audit logging for all authenticated operations
- [ ] Add token rotation capabilities for long-running processes

### 4. Toxicity Data Enhancements (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Complete toxicity table implementations per schema 012
- [ ] Optimize toxicity queries with appropriate indexes
- [ ] Create caching strategy for common toxicity lookups
- [ ] Implement batch processing for toxicity data imports
- [ ] Add toxicity data visualization capabilities

## Testing Strategy

- Establish baseline performance metrics through systematic benchmarking
- Create specific performance tests for RLS policy evaluation
- Implement connection pool stability tests (durability, recovery)
- Test concurrent access patterns for each optimized component

## Key Performance Indicators

- Query response time: < 100ms for standard queries, < 500ms for complex queries
- Connection acquisition time: < 10ms
- Database CPU utilization: < 40% under normal load
- RLS policy evaluation overhead: < 5ms per query

## Next Steps

1. Configure connection pooling parameters in the ConnectionPoolWrapper class
2. Apply unified service role policy to all remaining tables
3. Schedule regular integrity checks and materialized view refreshes
4. Develop a comprehensive testing plan for all optimizations
5. Document the implemented optimizations and their expected impact
