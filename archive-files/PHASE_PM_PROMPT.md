# Phase 2.1: API Layer Completion

You are the Project Manager for Phase 2.1 (API Layer Completion) of the CryoProtect v2 project. Your task is to complete all aspects of API standardization and improvement within this phase.

## Phase Overview

The CryoProtect v2 project is a scientific application for managing cryoprotectants, with a Flask backend and Supabase database. Phase 2.1 focuses on standardizing and improving the API layer to ensure consistency, reliability, and proper documentation.

## Your Responsibilities

1. Analyze the current state of the API implementation
2. Create a comprehensive plan for API standardization
3. Implement all required changes to complete the phase
4. Verify that all acceptance criteria are met
5. Provide a summary of work completed when the phase is done

## Key Deliverables

1. **Standardized Response Format**
   - Consistent response structure across all endpoints
   - Proper error handling and status codes
   - Validation using schemas

2. **Error Handling System**
   - Centralized error handling
   - Meaningful error messages and codes
   - Proper HTTP status code usage

3. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
   - Configure rate limits for API endpoints
   - Add rate limit headers to responses
   - Implement graceful handling of rate limit errors

4. **API Documentation**
   - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
   - Usage examples for all endpoints
   - Authentication requirements documentation

## Technical Context

- The application uses Flask for the API
- Endpoints are defined in various resource files under the `api/` directory
- Current response formats are inconsistent across endpoints
- Some endpoints lack proper error handling or status codes
- Documentation is incomplete or outdated

## Files to Work With

Primary files you'll need to modify:
- `api/resources.py` - Base API resource classes
- `api/utils.py` - Utility functions
- `api/schemas.py` - Data validation schemas
- Various resource files in `api/` directory
- Test files in `tests/` directory

## Implementation Approach

You should:
1. Start by examining the current API implementation
2. Create utility functions for standardized responses
3. Update the base resource class to use these utilities
4. Modify specific endpoints to use the new standard
5. Add tests to verify the implementation
6. Update or create documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

The phase is complete when:
1. All API endpoints use a consistent response format
2. Error handling is standardized across the API
3. Rate limiting is properly implemented
4. API documentation is complete and accurate
5. All tests pass
6. No regressions in existing functionality

## Reporting

When you've completed the phase, provide:
1. Summary of changes implemented
2. Any technical debt addressed or remaining
3. Test results showing functionality
4. Documentation of the API standards
5. Recommendations for future phases
