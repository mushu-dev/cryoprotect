# Missing RLS Policies Implementation

This document describes the implementation of Row Level Security (RLS) policies for tables and views that were missing proper security controls in the CryoProtect v2 application.

## Background

Row Level Security (RLS) is a critical security feature in PostgreSQL/Supabase that restricts access to rows based on user permissions. During deployment preparation, we identified several tables and views that were missing RLS policies:

1. `experiment_with_results`
2. `migrations` 
3. `mixture_with_components`
4. `molecule_with_properties`

## Implementation

We've created a comprehensive solution that adds RLS policies to these missing tables and views:

### 1. SQL Migration

The file `migrations/missing_rls_policies.sql` contains SQL statements to:

- Add SECURITY INVOKER to views (forcing them to respect underlying table RLS)
- Add explicit RLS policies for the `migrations` table
- Create the `experiment_with_results` view if missing
- Add service role policies for all underlying tables

### 2. Application Script

The `apply_missing_rls_policies.py` script:

- Connects to Supabase using credentials from the `.env` file
- Applies the SQL migration
- Verifies that RLS policies were correctly applied
- Logs the outcome for auditing purposes

### 3. Batch Scripts

For convenience, we've created platform-specific scripts:
- `apply_missing_rls_policies.bat` (Windows)
- `apply_missing_rls_policies.sh` (Unix/Linux/Mac)

## Usage

To apply the missing RLS policies:

### Windows
```
apply_missing_rls_policies.bat
```

### Unix/Linux/Mac
```
./apply_missing_rls_policies.sh
```

## Security Model

The implemented RLS policies follow these principles:

1. **Views** - Use SECURITY INVOKER to respect the RLS policies of their underlying tables
2. **Service Role** - Has access to all tables for database population and administration
3. **Project/Team Isolation** - Users can only access data from their own projects or teams
4. **Migrations Table** - Only the service role and admin users can access this table

## Verification

After applying the policies, the script performs verification checks to ensure:

1. Tables have RLS enabled
2. Views have SECURITY INVOKER set
3. Appropriate policies exist for each table

## Integration with Existing Security

These new policies complement the existing RLS implementation from:
- `migrations/006_rls_policies.sql` (Project-based RLS)
- `migrations/007_service_role_rls.sql` (Service role access)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs in the `logs/` directory
2. Verify Supabase connection settings in the `.env` file
3. Ensure you have admin privileges in Supabase
