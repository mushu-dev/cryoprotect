# CryoProtect v2 Phase 1 Implementation Directive

## Overview

This directive outlines the implementation of Phase 1: Essential Core Functionality for the CryoProtect v2 project. Phase 1 is the highest priority and focuses on implementing the lab verification workflow to validate prediction results against actual lab measurements.

## Current Status

The CryoProtect v2 project is approximately 75% complete overall. The critical missing functionality is the lab verification workflow, which is essential for validating the predictions made by the system against actual laboratory results.

## Phase 1 Objectives

Implement the essential core functionality with emphasis on:
1. Lab verification workflow implementation
2. API architecture standardization
3. Testing framework completion
4. Critical bug fixes

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Lab Verification Workflow Implementation (1.5 weeks)

#### Context
The project currently lacks a mechanism to validate predicted molecular properties against lab-verified measurements. This is a critical missing feature for scientific credibility.

#### Implementation Tasks
- Design and implement the `LabVerification` class in `api/models.py`
- Create database migration for lab verification schema in `migrations/013_lab_verification_schema.sql`
- Implement API resources for lab verification in new file `api/lab_verification_resources.py`
- Add frontend components for verification in new file `static/js/verification.js` 
- Create comprehensive tests for the verification workflow in `tests/test_lab_verification.py`

#### Implementation Details
Please refer to `/mnt/c/Users/1edwa/Documents/CryoProtect v2/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` which contains:
- Detailed class implementation for `LabVerification`
- SQL schema for lab verification table
- API resource implementation
- Test strategies

### 2. API Architecture Standardization (1 week)

#### Context
The API architecture needs standardization for consistency, maintainability, and reliability.

#### Implementation Tasks
- Standardize `api/resources.py` by applying consistent error handling, authentication, and response formatting
- Standardize `api/mixture_analysis_resources.py` following the same patterns
- Standardize `api/rdkit_resources.py` following the same patterns
- Address remaining resource files in usage frequency order

#### Standards to Apply
- Consistent error handling (`handle_error`)
- Authentication enforcement (`@token_required`)
- Response formatting (`@marshal_with` with field schemas)
- Request validation
- Comprehensive docstrings

### 3. Testing Framework Completion (1 week)

#### Context
The testing framework is 75% complete but needs finalization to ensure code quality and reliability.

#### Implementation Tasks
- Complete Test Data Fixtures implementation in `tests/fixtures/data_fixtures.py`
- Update Conftest to expose all fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`
- Run full test suite and verify coverage
- Address any remaining test failures or warnings

### 4. Critical Bug Fixes (0.5 weeks)

#### Context
Address any blocking issues to ensure core functionality works properly.

#### Implementation Tasks
- Fix any critical bugs in core functionality
- Ensure all essential workflows function properly
- Validate fixes with appropriate tests

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 will be considered complete when:
1. Lab verification workflow is fully implemented and tested
2. API architecture is standardized across all resource files
3. Testing framework is complete with >80% coverage
4. No critical bugs remain in core functionality

## Dependencies and Resources

1. **Existing Code**:
   - Experiment model in `api/models.py`
   - Comparison functionality in `api/comparisons.py`
   - API standardization patterns in `api/dashboard_resources.py`

2. **New Files to Create**:
   - `api/lab_verification_resources.py`
   - `migrations/013_lab_verification_schema.sql`
   - `static/js/verification.js`
   - `tests/test_lab_verification.py`

3. **Files to Modify**:
   - `api/models.py` (add LabVerification class)
   - `api/schemas.py` (add verification fields)
   - `api/comparisons.py` (enhance for verification)
   - `app.py` (register new routes)
   - Various templates to include verification UI

## Implementation Timeline

| Task | Duration | Dependencies |
|------|----------|--------------|
| LabVerification model | 2 days | None |
| Database migration | 1 day | LabVerification model |
| API resources | 2 days | LabVerification model, Database migration |
| Frontend components | 3 days | API resources |
| Testing | 2 days | All of the above |
| API Standardization | 5 days | None (can run parallel) |
| Testing Framework | 5 days | None (can run parallel) |
| Bug Fixes | 2-3 days | All of the above |

## Reporting and Communication

1. **Daily Updates**:
   - Tasks completed
   - Blockers encountered
   - Next day priorities

2. **Weekly Status Reports**:
   - Progress against timeline
   - Risk assessment
   - Resource allocation

## Risk Management

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Database schema changes: Ensure proper migration testing
   - Integration with existing models: Verify experiment model links correctly
   - API consistency: Ensure new endpoints follow standardization

2. **Timeline Risks**:
   - Scope creep: Focus strictly on essential functionality
   - Parallel work coordination: Clear task boundaries and dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Begin with implementing the `LabVerification` class in `api/models.py`
2. Create the database migration script in parallel
3. Use the implementation specifications in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` as a reference
4. Report progress daily
5. Raise any blockers or issues immediately
