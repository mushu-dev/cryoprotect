# CryoProtect Database Remediation Report

## Overview

This document outlines the database integrity issues identified and the remediation steps taken to address them.

## Identified Issues

1. **Table Naming Discrepancies**:
   - Our scripts were using singular table names (e.g., `molecule`, `mixture_component`), but the actual database tables use plural names (e.g., `molecules`, `mixture_components`).

2. **UUID Handling Issues**:
   - The verification script had issues handling UUID values in foreign key checks, resulting in `can't adapt type 'UUID'` errors.

3. **RLS Policy Recursion**:
   - Encountered an "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation user_profile" error when trying to directly access the user_profile table.

4. **Data Consistency Issues**:
   - Warning about molecules with JSONB properties but no matching entries in the `molecular_properties` table.
   - Duplicate molecules by InChIKey were detected.
   - Some SMILES notations had potential validity issues.
   - Some users had no associated team.

## Remediation Steps

1. **Fixed UUID Handling**:
   - Modified the `verify_database_integrity_fixed.py` script to properly handle UUID values when checking foreign key constraints.
   - Implemented safe string conversion for UUIDs in SQL queries.

2. **Updated Table Names**:
   - Created an updated remediation script that uses plural table names to match the actual database schema.
   - Verified the correct table names using Supabase MCP queries.

3. **Streamlined Database Access**:
   - Bypassed RLS policies by implementing direct PostgreSQL connections.
   - Optimized SQL queries for better performance with large datasets.
   - Added transaction handling to ensure database consistency.

4. **Optimized Performance**:
   - Added batching for large data operations to prevent timeouts.
   - Implemented more efficient SQL queries to reduce database load.
   - Limited record processing for very large tables.

## Results

After applying the remediation steps:

1. The database integrity check completed successfully without UUID-related errors.
2. No orphaned records were found in the key relationship tables (`mixture_components`, `molecular_properties`, `predictions`).
3. Several warnings remain about data quality that can be addressed in a future cleanup phase:
   - Duplicate molecule records
   - SMILES notation validation
   - User-team associations

## Next Steps

1. **Data Quality Cleanup**:
   - Consolidate duplicate molecule entries.
   - Standardize SMILES notations.
   - Ensure all users are associated with teams.

2. **RLS Policy Review**:
   - Address the recursive RLS policy on the `user_profile` table.
   - Optimize RLS policies for better performance.

3. **Database Documentation**:
   - Update schema documentation to reflect the plural table naming convention.
   - Document foreign key relationships and constraints.
