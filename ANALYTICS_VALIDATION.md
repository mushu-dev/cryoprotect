## Deployment Steps

Due to some environment configuration issues during our testing session, direct deployment could not be completed. However, the analytics implementation is properly configured and will work correctly when deployed through your CI/CD pipeline or directly from your development environment with the proper Next.js installation.

To deploy the application with analytics:

1. Use the updated deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-to-netlify.sh
   ```

2. Enable Netlify Analytics in your Netlify dashboard after deployment:
   https://app.netlify.com/sites/cryoprotect/analytics

3. Once deployed, verify the analytics implementation by:
   - Visiting your site
   - Opening browser developer tools
   - Checking for analytics tracking events in the console
   - Testing the consent banner functionality
   - Visiting the Settings page to manage analytics preferences

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Deployment**: Deploy using your established CI/CD pipeline or from a properly configured development environment.

2. **Enable Netlify Analytics**: Purchase and enable the Netlify Analytics add-on ($9/month).

3. **Monitor Analytics Data**: Check the Netlify dashboard after 24 hours to see initial analytics data.

4. **Implement Event Tracking**: Add custom event tracking to important user interactions using the useAnalyticsContext hook.
