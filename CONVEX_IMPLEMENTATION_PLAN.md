# CryoProtect Convex Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the final plan for reimagining and implementing the CryoProtect database using Convex. After a comprehensive analysis of the current Supabase implementation and Convex's capabilities, we've identified the optimal approach for leveraging Convex's document-oriented model and reactivity features while maintaining all scientific data integrity requirements.

The plan addresses identified gaps, technical debt risks, and implementation challenges to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to users. Our approach emphasizes data integrity, scientific validation, and performance optimization while taking full advantage of Convex's strengths.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Scientific Integrity First**: Ensure all scientific data and calculations remain accurate
2. **Leverage Convex Strengths**: Take advantage of document model and reactivity
3. **Graceful Migration**: Ensure zero data loss and minimal disruption
4. **Performance Optimization**: Maintain or improve query performance for critical operations
5. **Maintainable Architecture**: Create a clean, well-documented implementation
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate all aspects of the system during transition

## Database Model

### Schema Design

The Convex database model will use the following tables and relationships, optimized for document-oriented storage:

```typescript
// Core Tables
molecules
molecularProperties
propertyTypes
mixtures
mixtureComponents
experiments
experimentResults
predictions
scientificModels

// Supporting Tables
dataSources
moleculeSynonyms
moleculeCrossReferences
toxicityData
toxicityAssays
users
projects
teamMembers
scientificDataAudit
```

See the detailed schema definition with all fields, types, and indexes in `schema/convex_schema.ts`.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Molecule Consolidation**: Implemented using direct references and status flags rather than views
2. **Property Storage**: Maintaining type flexibility while optimizing for common queries
3. **Query Optimization**: Strategic denormalization and indexing for performance-critical operations
4. **Security Model**: Function-level authorization replacing PostgreSQL RLS policies
5. **Audit System**: Comprehensive audit trail for all scientific data changes
