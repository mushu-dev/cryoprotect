# Product Requirements Document: Connection Pool Optimization
# Related Issue: #126
# Created: 2025-05-08

## Overview
The CryoProtect application needs an optimized database connection pool to handle increased concurrent load and ensure stable performance during heavy usage. The current implementation suffers from connection leaks and inefficient connection management, leading to performance degradation over time.

## Requirements
- Implement a robust connection pooling mechanism that efficiently manages database connections
- Ensure connections are properly closed after use to prevent leaks
- Support a configurable number of maximum concurrent connections (default: 20)
- Implement connection timeout handling to prevent hanging operations
- Provide a clean API for acquiring and releasing connections
- Include metrics collection for pool health monitoring
- Ensure thread safety for all connection pool operations
- Optimize for the Supabase PostgreSQL environment
- Support proper handling of transaction contexts
- Provide graceful error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Context
- **Current Architecture**: The application currently uses direct connections to Supabase PostgreSQL with basic connection management in `database/connection_manager.py`
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Database adapters in `database/adapter.py`
  - Supabase client in `api/supabase_client.py`
  - Transaction utilities in `transaction_utils.py`
- **Existing Code**: 
  - Current connection handling in `database/connection.py:45-120`
  - Transaction management in `transaction_utils.py:25-78`
  - Environment configuration in `config.py:80-95`

## Constraints
- **Performance**: Must support at least 100 concurrent users with response times under 500ms
- **Security**: Must maintain secure connection parameters and not expose sensitive information
- **Compatibility**: Must work with both Supabase hosted PostgreSQL and local development databases
- **Resource Limitations**: Must work within the connection limits of the Supabase free tier (initially)
- **SELinux**: Must respect SELinux contexts for Fedora deployment

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Connection pool successfully creates and manages a configurable number of connections
- [ ] Under heavy load (100+ concurrent requests), the application maintains response times under 500ms
- [ ] No connection leaks observed after 24 hours of operation with variable load
- [ ] Connection pool metrics are available for monitoring
- [ ] Connection errors are properly handled and reported
- [ ] Unit tests demonstrate proper connection acquisition, release, and error handling
- [ ] Integration tests show improved performance compared to current implementation
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains how to use and configure the connection pool

## Additional Notes
- Consider implementing HikariCP-like features (popular Java connection pool)
- Reference SQLAlchemy's connection pool implementation for inspiration
- The connection pool should be a singleton to prevent multiple pools
- Monitor for PostgreSQL "too many connections" errors during implementation
- This is a critical component that affects overall system stability
