# Connection Pool Optimization

## Overview
Implement optimized connection pooling for improved database performance in the Fedora environment, specifically for Supabase PostgreSQL connections. This will reduce connection overhead, maintain consistent response times under load, and avoid connection exhaustion issues previously encountered.

## Requirements
- Implement a robust connection pool using optimized_connection_pool.py
- Configure pool size based on system resources (min: 5, max: 20)
- Implement connection timeout handling with exponential backoff
- Add health check monitoring for connection status
- Implement graceful pool shutdown for application restart
- Add metrics collection for connection usage patterns
- Create reusable connection wrapper with automatic retry logic
- Ensure SELinux compatibility for network connections
- Add detailed logging of connection lifecycle events
- Implement connection validation before returning to pool
- Create unit tests that verify pool behavior under stress

## Technical Context
The current system uses direct database connections which has led to performance issues under load and occasional connection exhaustion. The optimized_connection_pool.py script provides a foundation but needs significant enhancements for production-level robustness.

Key integration points:
- database/connection_manager.py (handles connection logistics)
- database/adapter.py (provides database abstraction)
- config.py (contains connection configuration)

Key files to modify:
- optimized_connection_pool.py (Main implementation)
- test_optimized_connection_pool.py (Test suite)
- database/connection_manager.py (Integration point)

## Constraints
- Must support PostgreSQL 14+ on Fedora Linux
- Must handle network interruptions gracefully
- Must be compatible with SELinux security policies
- Connection pool stats must be exposed for monitoring
- Must properly handle transaction isolation levels
- Maximum memory usage should not exceed 200MB
- Must be configurable via environment variables
- Should not require application code changes to use

## Acceptance Criteria
- Connection pool maintains at least 95% of optimal performance under 100 concurrent users
- No connection timeouts during normal operation
- Successful recovery after network interruptions without user impact
- All unit tests pass on Fedora with SELinux enforcing
- Connection metrics show proper pool utilization
- No memory leaks after 24 hours of operation under load
- Connection pool gracefully handles database restarts
