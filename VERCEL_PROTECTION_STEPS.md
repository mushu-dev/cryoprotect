# Disabling Vercel Authentication Protection

To make your Vercel deployment accessible without requiring login, you need to disable Password Protection in the Vercel dashboard.

## Steps to Disable Vercel Authentication

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. Select your project (e.g., "analytics-demo" or "cryoprotect")

3. Click on the "Settings" tab

4. In the left sidebar, find and click on "Authentication"

5. Under "Password Protection", toggle it OFF

6. Save your changes

## Testing Your Deployment

After disabling authentication protection, visit your deployment URL:

```
https://analytics-demo-ehkrn0zdx-mushu-dev.vercel.app
```

You should now be able to access it without logging in.

## Alternative: Creating a New Project Through Dashboard

If you continue to have issues, you can create a project directly through the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your repository or create from a template
3. In the project settings, make sure "Password Protection" is turned OFF
4. Deploy the project

## Installing Analytics in Your Main Project

Once you have a working deployment with access to analytics, you can follow these steps to add Analytics to your main project:

1. Fix the dependency conflicts in your package.json:
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "react": "18.2.0",
     "react-dom": "18.2.0",
     "@react-three/drei": "^9.80.0",
     "@react-three/fiber": "^8.13.6",
     "@vercel/analytics": "^1.0.1",
     "@vercel/speed-insights": "^1.0.1"
   }
   ```

2. Add the components to your layout:
   ```jsx
   import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'
   import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'

   // In your layout component
   return (
     <div>
       {/* Your app content */}
       <Analytics />
       <SpeedInsights />
     </div>
   )
   ```

3. Deploy your application again after these changes
