# Disabling Authentication Protection in Vercel Dashboard

Follow these steps to disable authentication protection for your Vercel deployment:

## Step 1: Access Project Settings

1. Open your browser and go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Login if needed
3. Select your project (`deploy_temp` or other project name)

## Step 2: Navigate to Authentication Settings

1. In the project dashboard, click on **Settings** tab at the top
2. On the left sidebar, look for **Security** or **Authentication**
3. You may also check under **Domain Settings**

## Step 3: Disable Password Protection

1. Look for an option called **Password Protection**, **Authentication**, or similar
2. Toggle it OFF or click disable
3. Save your changes

## Step 4: Check Team Settings

1. Go to your team settings (if applicable)
2. Check if there are any team-wide authentication settings
3. Disable any password protection there as well

## Step 5: Setup Custom Domain (Alternative)

If you can't disable authentication, try adding a custom domain:

1. In project settings, click on **Domains**
2. Add a custom domain you own
3. Verify it following Vercel's instructions
4. Custom domains often bypass the authentication requirement

## Step 6: Try Deployment Commands

Use one of these commands from your project directory:

```bash
# Try deploying with team scope
vercel --scope mushu-dev --public

# Try deploying with protection bypass
vercel --env VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS=1

# Try deploying with team and production flags
vercel --scope mushu-dev --prod --public
```

## Step 7: Consider Using GitHub Pages Instead

If Vercel authentication still cannot be disabled, consider using GitHub Pages as an alternative:

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push your static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`

GitHub Pages has no authentication requirement and is completely free.

## Note About Vercel Free Personal Accounts

On free personal Vercel accounts, preview deployments (non-production) almost always require authentication. This is a limitation of the free plan.

For completely public access, consider:
1. Using a team account
2. Deploying to production
3. Using a custom domain
4. Switching to GitHub Pages or Netlify
